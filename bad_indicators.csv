"2","“A currency beyond the nation state:  The euro and its institutional challenges ahead”   Dinner speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,at Société d’Economie Politique,Paris, 16 November 2015 Ladies and gentlemen, I am deeply shocked by what happened here over the weekend. Those atrocious attacks have killed and wounded hundreds of people. I would like to express my solidarity, my compassion, and my sincere condolences to the families and friends of the victims. Our societies are founded on a social contract. A common understanding of fundamental values and principles, such as democracy, the rule of law and human rights, forms the basis for peaceful coexistence. Such a social contract need not be constrained to the national level. It can also – and does – exist at the supra-national level. It is on this basis that, in Europe, Member States share sovereignty, most notably as some of us share a “currency beyond the state”.  In my remarks today, I will:   first, lay out the legal scope for sharing sovereignty; and   second, elaborate on what this means for further European integration in different policy areas.   The Lisbon Treaty sets out several restrictions regarding the transfer of sovereignty from the national to the European level:    Sovereignty in the Union rests with the Member States. The Union owes its existence to the Member States, as they confer competences on the Union in order to attain common objectives (Article 1 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)).   National security remains the sole responsibility of the constituent states (Article 4 Paragraph 2, TFEU).   The Union is governed by the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality (Article 5 TFEU).   As you can see, the letter and spirit of the Lisbon Treaty do not suggest that the EU should be transformed into a sovereign state called Europe. Nevertheless, some national constitutional courts saw the need to further emphasise that Member States remain viable and independent political entities, coining the term “constitutional identity”. Constitutional identity assumes that each Member State enjoys the right to democratic self-determination through its own institutions, in particular national parliaments elected by the people. However, distinguishing between the original, constituent power of the people and the derived, constituted power of the legislator does not limit the ability to share sovereignty. Only a very radical interpretation of constitutional identity would dictate that competences cannot be transferred to another entity without violating the original power of the people. Such an interpretation is based on the antiquated belief that the nation state is the sole locus of legitimacy. This belief is rooted in the so-called Westphalian model of international relations. It assumes that only the nation state has sovereignty over its territory and domestic affairs. This model refers to the Peace of Westphalia – a series of peace treaties signed between May and October 1648 in Osnabrück and Münster (in Germany). These treaties ended the Thirty Years’ War (1618-48) in the Holy Roman Empire, and the Eighty Years’ War (1568-1648), in which the Kingdom of Spain, the Dutch Republic, the Kingdom of France, the Swedish Empire and sovereigns of the free imperial cities were also involved.  The Westphalian model was justified as a means to end the long-lasting wars back in 1648. However, some 300 years later, after two devastating wars, the dangers of a warped understanding of patriotism, i.e. nationalism, became apparent. Overcoming the limits of the nation state was a precondition for a peaceful Europe. Sharing sovereignty rather than sacrificing it has been the preferred method of achieving this.  Indeed, the European approach since then has shown that democratic states can share sovereignty in a number of policy areas without losing statehood. The EU has developed an identity as a union not only of Member States, but also of citizens establishing a model of transnational democracy with an elected, European Parliament and an independent Court of Justice (the ECJ). EU citizens have ample reason to say, as the incoming President of the ECJ, Koen Lenaerts, once put it: Civis Europaeus sum. [1]  The Treaty signed by Member States also confers rights to citizenship which can be claimed in the European courts. In particular, the euro area has shown that like-minded people and their governments can introduce, manage and safeguard a single currency without having to merge into one overarching federal state. The “currency beyond the state” [2] has revealed as false the widespread belief that a monetary union without a state is not viable. There is a broad consensus that the design and implementation of monetary policy should be taken out of the political arena to protect citizens’ purchasing power from short-term temptations and pressures of the election cycle. This is why monetary policy was transferred to an independent institution, the ECB. While independent, the ECB is accountable to a democratically elected body, the European Parliament. Our decisions are taken at the European level. They are taken in the interest of Europe. And – as a logical consequence – they are democratically legitimised at the European level. Currently, this democratic control includes parliamentarians from countries that do not share the currency of the Union, which the Treaty explicitly states as being the euro. This logic cannot, however, be directly applied to all other policy areas. Deciding on taxation and the allocation of budgetary expenditures is the core competence of national parliaments, and for good reason. Taxation mirrors the people’s preferences for the supply of public goods and – just as importantly – their willingness to finance these public goods. Taxation and the allocation of budgetary expenditures, therefore, requires a high degree of democratic legitimacy and parliamentary control at the national level. The concept of a European taxpayer, briefly discussed during the negotiations leading up to the Maastricht Treaty, did not end up being included in the Treaty.  This is currently a national prerogative, but that does not mean that we should shy away from further fiscal integration in the long run. We just need to get it right. One of the ideas currently being discussed is a euro area-wide fiscal stabilisation function. This function could help to better cushion the economy against large macroeconomic shocks that cannot be dealt with at the national level alone. For such euro area stabilisation to work, however, we first need a significant degree of economic convergence and financial integration according to the Five Presidents’ Report. [3]  In any case, a fiscal stabilisation function is meant to be just that: a stabilisation function. It should not be misused to introduce a transfer system through the back door. A fiscal stabilisation function could be managed by a euro-area treasury that would be responsible for those fiscal policy decisions that are more effectively dealt with at the European level than at the national level.  Such a euro area treasury or finance ministry would clearly need a high degree of democratic legitimacy and strong parliamentary control. Any college with powers delegated from intergovernmental forums would hardly satisfy these requirements. In my view, the European Parliament convening in euro area composition would be the right body to undertake this task. It would ensure that the actions of a European finance minister are legitimised at the same level at which decisions are taken. A high degree of democratic legitimacy also implies that a European finance minister cannot be an unelected technocrat. Under the current institutional framework, he or she certainly cannot be a delegate from the Eurogroup. In an integrated Union, this informal, intergovernmental body lacks its raison d’être. Could a delegate from the European Commission assume this position? In principle, yes. With the election of its President and the vetting of Commissioners by the European Parliament, the European Commission enjoys a higher degree of democratic legitimacy than various intergovernmental gatherings. However, the Commission is increasingly experiencing tensions between its ever-more political orientation and its role as the guardian of the Treaties. These tensions would need to be solved first. And a “Spitzenkandidat” is not an elected President. Any such moves towards closer fiscal integration will need time. Some of them require treaty changes for which I currently do not see political willingness. Given the urgency of the crisis, the minimum consensus was therefore to temporarily opt for intergovernmental arrangements to increase the Union’s resilience. This ought to be a temporary solution to avoid tensions of a political and legal nature between community and intergovernmental institutions. For instance, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) was established as an intergovernmental institution that, for tasks such as payments, still requires prior consent from national parliaments. As soon as there is political willingness to change the treaties, the ESM should be made a proper European institution. In the longer run the intergovernmental approach is a dead end. Let me conclude by summarising my main point. While legal doctrine is important and necessary, it needs to be free of ideological interference and must not be used for purposes that go beyond its legal nature. If national courts claim the right to defend national sovereign prerogatives over and above the decisions of their democratically elected representatives, the legal doctrine of “constitutional identity” morphs into a political question. There is then a risk that sovereignty becomes an ideological concept. Such “sovereignism” clashes with any attempt at further European integration. It could result in a failure to complete the European integration process. It should not be used as an excuse to opt for intergovernmental arrangements where supranational solutions would be more conducive to achieving a genuine Economic and Monetary Union. The European integration process has demonstrated that democratic states can share sovereignty in a number of policy areas without losing statehood. Nevertheless, we need to take into account that some policy areas do need a higher degree of democratic legitimacy and parliamentary control at the national level than others. This reasoning in no way supports those championing a national or constitutional identity. Rather, it illustrates the need for different approaches to the respective policy areas, especially as the concept of constitutional identity has not only hampered deeper integration but risks winding back earlier achievements. As Jaap Hoeksma, philosopher of law put it, “the transition of the EU from an international organisation to a European democracy has proceeded faster than most euro-sceptics” predicted; at the same time, “the quality of this […] democracy [still] needs more improvements than euro enthusiasts tend to assume”.

"3","„Better Regulation“ im Finanzsektor – die Sicht der Europäischen Zentralbank   Rede von Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Mitglied des Direktoriums der EZBBankenseminar: „Demografischer Wandel – Konsequenzen und Implikationen für Finanzmärkte und Banken“Europäisches Forum, Alpbach, 29. August 2007 Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,  ich freue mich, in Alpbach zu sein und mit Ihnen über „Better Regulation“ (oder: „Bessere Rechtsetzung“) zu diskutieren. Ich könnte unter diesem Titel mindestens 3 verschiedene Referate halten:  Thema Nr. 1: Weniger Regulierung und vor allem weniger neue Initiativen  Erst im März dieses Jahres haben die Staats- und Regierungschefs beschlossen, bis 2012 die Bürokratiekosten in der EU um 25 % zu verringern.  Europa hat den Rechtsrahmen im Finanzsektor in den letzten Jahren modernisiert, harmonisiert und die Standards angehoben. Dies hat eine Fülle von Veränderungen und entsprechende Implementierungskosten mit sich gebracht. Der Erfolg wird von der einheitlichen Implementierung abhängen – nur dann werden die Regeln auch dem gemeinsamen Markt gerecht werden. Das Festhalten an der Vielfalt von Regeln wird zum Teil auch als Bürokratie erlebt. In diesem Zusammenhang sollte kritisch über das Ausmaß an Regeln nachgedacht werden. Thema Nr. 2: Mehr Regulierung  In der nächsten Zeit wird es Diskussionen über die Wirksamkeit von Risikobegrenzungsregeln, die Angemessenheit von Liquiditätsregeln, Stress Testing, Risiken außerhalb der Bankbilanzen, Ratingagenturen, etc. geben. Ich möchte dieser Debatte nicht vorgreifen. Thema Nr. 3: „Better Regulation“, die Entstehung der Regulierung. Auf dieses Thema möchte ich mich heute konzentrieren. „Better Regulation“ verpflichtet staatliche Akteure dazu, das „Ob“ und „Wie“ staatlicher Eingriffe kritisch zu hinterfragen. Es steht somit für einen neuen Politikansatz, der zu Transparenz, Verhältnismäßigkeit und Klarheit verpflichtet. [1] In einer Union von 27 Mitgliedstaaten mit ganz unterschiedlichen Rechtsetzungs­traditionen und einem Binnenmarkt für über 500 Millionen Bürger ist ein solcher Politikansatz von besonderer Bedeutung. Seit dem Maastricht-Vertrag ist das Subsidiaritätsprinzip eine wichtige Maxime des gesetzgeberischen Handelns der EU und verpflichtet die Union nur dann aktiv zu werden, wenn Lösungen auf der lokalen und der nationalen Ebene nicht greifen. Gleichzeitig erfordert die Schaffung des gemeinsamen Rechts für Finanzdienstleistungen ein ‚Streamlining’ des ‚gewachsenen’ Rechtsrahmens.  Ich möchte im Folgenden auf das Zusammenspiel von Finanzmärkten und europäischer Regulierung eingehen. Dabei werde ich mich auf die Finanzmarkt­infrastrukturen konzentrieren und Ihnen konkrete Beispiele für „Better Regulation“ geben.  Aufsicht an den europäischen Finanzmärkten und das Konzept einer „Better Regulation“  Der regulatorische Rahmen eines Landes hat erhebliche Auswirkungen auf sein Wirtschaftswachstum und seine internationale Wettbewerbsfähigkeit. In einigen Ländern sind die Regierungen daher bereits seit längerer Zeit im Bereich „Better Regulation“ tätig. So wurde z. B. im Vereinigten Königreich vor zehn Jahren eine Better Regulation Task Force eingerichtet, die später von der Better Regulation Commission, einem ständigen Beratungsgremium der Regierung, abgelöst wurde.  Die Behörden in Europa sind zunehmend für die Notwendigkeit einer „Better Regulation“ – nicht nur auf nationaler, sondern auch auf Gemeinschaftsebene – sensibilisiert. Auch der Druck seitens der Adressaten von Regulierung nimmt zu: Ende 2006 veröffentlichte das Institute of International Finance (IIF) einen Vorschlag für einen strategischen Dialog über effektive Rechtsetzung, und vor Kurzem legte auch der International Council of Securities Associations (ICSA) Richtlinien für eine „Better Regulation“ vor. Die Europäische Kommission hat im vergangenen Jahr ein ehrgeiziges Programm zur Entwicklung einer „Better Regulation“ in der EU initiiert. Im Rahmen dieses Programms wird eine Prüfung der bestehenden Rechtsvorschriften vorgenommen, um überholte Bestimmungen zu vereinfachen oder aufzuheben. Außerdem wurde ein neuer Ausschuss für Folgenabschätzung (Impact Assessment Board) eingesetzt, dessen Aufgabe es ist, Folgenabschätzungen in Bezug auf Vorschläge der Kommission für neue Rechtsvorschriften durchzuführen [2]. Das endgültige Ziel ist die Verringerung der Verwaltungslasten und -kosten sowie die Schaffung eines klaren und einfachen rechtlichen Rahmens. Im Finanzsektor sind bereits erste konkrete Ergebnisse zu verzeichnen, wie z. B. die Anwendung der Konsolidierungs- und Überarbeitungsmethoden bei der kürzlich verabschiedeten Eigenkapitalrichtlinie, die – wie Sie wissen – die Basel‑II‑Rahmenvereinbarung in der EU widerspiegelt.  Angesichts der Interdependenz zwischen einem guten rechtlichen und regulatorischen Rahmenwerk und effizienten Finanzmärkten unterstützt die EZB diese Initiativen der Kommission ausdrücklich.  Bei der Regulierung des Finanzsektors in Europa kommt den Lamfalussy-Ausschüssen eine zentrale Rolle zu. Sie wurden mit dem Ziel eingerichtet, den regulatorischen Rahmen der Gemeinschaft zu verbessern. Im Dezember wird der ECOFIN-Rat das Funktionieren des Lamfalussy-Konzepts überprüfen. Zurzeit werden mögliche Verbesserungen der aktuellen Regelungen erörtert. Der Lamfalussy-Ansatz wird derzeit sowohl von den öffentlichen Stellen als auch von den Marktteilnehmern unterstützt, und die Arbeit der Stufe-3-Ausschüsse (CEBS, CEIOPS und CESR) wird allgemein gelobt.  Aus Sicht des Eurosystems haben die Ausschüsse bisher zu mehr Konvergenz beigetragen. Die engere Zusammenarbeit zwischen den Aufsichtsinstanzen des Heimat- und des Gastlandes erleichtert die Überwachung der Finanzmarktstabilität und die Entwicklung und Umsetzung von Maßnahmen sowie die grenzüberschreitende Verbreitung von optimalen Verfahren („Best practices“). Die Entwicklung gemeinsamer Standards und Richtlinien verbessert die Qualität der Finanzaufsicht weiter und verringert die aus der Einhaltung der Regeln für grenzüberschreitend tätige Institute resultierende Belastung.  Nach einer ersten Bewertung des Lamfalussy-Ansatzes durch den Ausschuss für Finanzdienstleistungen empfahl der ECOFIN-Rat im Jahr 2006 folgende Maßnahmen:      Instrumente, die zur Schaffung einer gemeinsamen aufsichtlichen Kultur beitragen; hierzu gehören regelmäßige Seminare und Workshops der Stufe-3-Ausschüsse, grenzüberschreitende Entsendungen von Mitarbeitern und gemeinsame Aufsichts­besuche;    Möglichkeit der nicht verbindlichen Schlichtung zwischen Aufsichtsbehörden bei alltäglichen Unstimmigkeiten;   Delegieren von Aufsichtsaufgaben und längerfristig auch von Aufsichtsbefugnissen;   Straffung der Informationen für grenzüberschreitende Geschäfte, z. B. durch die Verwendung gemeinsamer Ausweis- und Offenlegungsformate, vereinfachte Ausweisverfahren und gemeinsame Datennutzung.      Da die Stufe-3-Ausschüsse diese Empfehlungen zurzeit umsetzen, ist es für eine Beurteilung ihrer Wirksamkeit noch zu früh.  Die Debatte zur grundlegenden Überprüfung des Lamfalussy-Ansatzes in allen Finanzmarktsektoren ist dennoch eröffnet. Die interinstitutionelle Überwachungsgruppe (Inter-Institutional Monitoring Group, IIMG) wird ihre Empfehlungen im Herbst veröffentlichen, und die EZB wird dazu Stellung nehmen. Maßnahmen, welche die Entscheidungsfindung der Ausschüsse erleichtern (wie qualifizierte Mehrheiten) wären aus meiner Sicht ein möglicher Schritt zur Festigung des europäischen Aufsichtswesen. Lag ein Schwerpunkt der Arbeit der Stufe-3-Ausschüsse bisher bei der Beratung der Kommission in Regulierungsfragen, wird die Entscheidung und Interpretation von Aufsichtsfragen immer stärker an Bedeutung gewinnen. Integrierte Märkte brauchen dabei eine im Ergebnis einheitliche „Governance“, auch wenn diese Aufgabe von den nationalen Aufsehern in Eigenverantwortung erfüllt wird. Bislang habe ich die europäische Sicht der Debatte über „Better Regulation“ in den Mittelpunkt gestellt, aber die internationale Komponente ist natürlich ebenfalls von großer Bedeutung. Die hohe Volatilität, die in den letzten Wochen an den Finanzmärkten zu beobachten war, führt uns deutlich vor Augen, dass wir in einem globalen Finanzsystem leben und Probleme, die in einem Teil der Welt bestehen, schnell auf andere Teile übergreifen können. Die weltweite Koordination von regulatorischen Maßnahmen sollte daher wesentlicher Bestandteil der Agenda einer „Better Regulation“ sein. Hedgefonds, Grundsätze der Rechnungslegung und Kapitalanforderungen für Banken und sonstige der Aufsicht unterliegende Finanzinstitute sind nur drei Beispiele für Bereiche, in denen eine internationale regulatorische Koordination besonders wichtig ist.  Strukturen wie der Basler Ausschuss für Bankenaufsicht und der regelmäßig stattfindende Dialog über Finanzmarktregulierung zwischen der EU und den Vereinigten Staaten, Japan, China und anderen Regionen haben bereits zu guten Ergebnissen geführt. Wichtig ist die wechselseitige Anerkennung vergleichbarer Regeln in den einzelnen Regionen. Die nunmehr erreichte Einigung mit den USA, dass ab 2009 europäische Firmen, die nach IFRS bilanzieren, nicht zusätzlich nach US-GAAP bilanzieren müssen, wenn sie in den USA tätig sind, ist ein positiver Schritt.  Finanzmarktinfrastruktur und Finanzmarktintegration  Das Konzept der „Better Regulation“ ist auch im Bereich der Zahlungsverkehrs- und Abwicklungsinfrastrukturen von maßgeblicher Bedeutung, und somit auch eine Maxime des Eurosystems. Das Eurosystem erfüllt die ihm durch den Vertrag über die Europäische Union übertragene Aufgabe der Förderung des reibungslosen Funktionierens der Zahlungs- und Abwicklungssysteme mittels dreier verschiedener Funktionen: als Katalysator, als Überwachungsinstanz und als Systembetreiber. Als Katalysator unterstützen wir bei der Überwindung von Hindernissen – technischer, organisatorischer, regulatorischer oder auch rechtlicher Natur – beratend und sind koordinierend tätig. Wenn Marktteilnehmer existierende Problemstellungen zur Zufriedenheit der Aufsichtsbehörden in Eigenverantwortung und mittels Selbstregulierung lösen, ist dies „Better Regulation“.  In den letzten Jahren wurde mit dem Projekt ‚SEPA’, das in seiner Dimension und in seinen Auswirkungen nicht unterschätzt werden sollte, ein gutes Beispiel für Selbstregulierung und Modernisierung gesetzt. Von fragmentierten nationalen Systemen zu gleichen Regeln und Standards war es ein Quantensprung. Nimmt das Eurosystem eine Überwachungsfunktion wahr, so werden Dienstleistungen von den Marktteilnehmern im Einklang mit den Regeln und Standards des Eurosystems erbracht. Beim Erlass dieser Regeln und Standards wird stets die Frage der Notwendigkeit und Angemessenheit gestellt. Zudem konsultiert das Eurosystem vor der Einführung neuer Regeln und Standards den Markt, um auch dessen Meinung gebührend in Betracht ziehen zu können. Wenn es um die Effizienz und insbesondere die Sicherheit des Zahlungsverkehrs geht, muss die Messlatte mit Blick auf die Finanzstabilität jedoch entsprechend hoch liegen, um die Wahrscheinlichkeit des Auftretens schwerwiegender Störungen im Interesse der Marktteilnehmer sowie der Gesamtwirtschaft so gering wie möglich zu halten. Beispiele in diesem Zusammenhang sind die im Mai 2007 veröffentlichten Konsultationen über (i) die Überwachung von systemisch relevanten Zahlungssystemen und von Zahlungskartensystemen. Die dritte Funktion, seine Rolle als Systembetreiber, übernimmt das Eurosystem nur dann, wenn der Markt entsprechende Lösungen nicht anbietet oder nicht anbieten kann, z. B. die Einführung des Großzahlungssystems TARGET und dessen Nachfolgesystems TARGET2. Das TARGET-System bietet dem Markt eine sichere und effiziente Möglichkeit, Großbetragszahlungen innerhalb Europas abzuwickeln, und hat maßgeblich zur Schaffung eines einheitlichen europäischen Geldmarkts beigetragen. Ein weiteres Beispiel für die Rolle des Eurosystems als Systembetreiber ist die geplante Plattform für die europaweite Wertpapierabwicklung in Zentralbankgeld, TARGET2-Securities, kurz T2S. Auch im Rahmen dieser Aktivitäten konsultiert das Eurosystem die Marktteilnehmer, um sein Angebot an deren Bedürfnissen ausrichten zu können.  Bei T2S handelt es sich um ein Projekt des Eurosystems, mit dem die gegenwärtige Fragmentierung bei der Wertpapierabwicklung in Europa überwunden werden soll, um Europa im internationalen Kontext konkurrenzfähiger zu machen. Heutzutage ist die Verrechnung von Wertpapiergeschäften lediglich auf nationaler Ebene als effizient zu bezeichnen. Die grenzüberschreitende Wertpapierabwicklung ist hingegen ausgesprochen heterogen und dadurch komplex, was sie im Endeffekt ineffizient und teuer macht. Es fällt hier zurzeit ein Vielfaches der nationalen Abwicklungsgebühren an. Durch T2S wird es in Zukunft möglich sein, die Wertpapierabwicklung in Zentralbankgeld im grenzüberschreitenden Verkehr genauso effizient und kostengünstig zu gestalten wie auf nationaler Ebene. Zu Beginn wird T2S vermutlich nur für die Zahlungsabwicklung in Euro bereitstehen, bei Bedarf kann die Funktionalität jedoch auf andere europäische Währungen ausgeweitet werden.  Das Eurosystem hat die Initiative für das T2S Projekt ergriffen, nachdem es im Bereich der Wertpapierabwicklung auch acht Jahre nach der Einführung des Euro lediglich zu sehr rudimentären Ansätzen einer Finanzmarktintegration gekommen ist. Dabei möchte ich betonen, dass es sich bei T2S  nicht  um die Schaffung eines neuen, europäischen Zentralverwahrers handelt, sondern dass die bestehenden Zentralverwahrer lediglich die Verrechnung von Wertpapiergeschäften auf eine zentrale technische Plattform – T2S – auslagern. Alle anderen Funktionen verbleiben weiterhin und ausschließlich bei den Zentralverwahrern selbst und werden seitens T2S durch die Bereitstellung benötigter Informationen unterstützt.  Durch diese europaweite Bündelung der Wertpapierverrechnung ergeben sich substanzielle wirtschaftliche Vorteile. Bei einer Anzahl von 160 Millionen Transaktionen im Jahr (2006) dürfte es durch Skaleneffekte zu einer deutlichen Verminderung der Transaktionskosten kommen. Darüber hinaus wird es für Investoren attraktiver, auch grenzüberschreitende Anlagemöglichkeiten in Betracht zu ziehen, und durch die Zentralisierung der Abwicklung bietet sich weiterhin die Möglichkeit zur Erhöhung der Liquidität in den emittierten Werten. Dies alles sollte zu einer effizienteren Preisgestaltung für die zugrunde liegenden Wertpapiere beitragen.  Zusammenfassend möchte ich noch einmal betonen, dass das Eurosystem dem Markt mit T2S eine Infrastruktur bereitstellen möchte, die zur technischen Integration des europäischen Wertpapiermarktes beitragen wird.  Lassen Sie mich zum Abschluss zusammenfassen.      Die „Better Regulation“-Initiative zielt auf die Vereinfachung und Modernisierung der derzeitigen Verfahren ab und bietet außerdem ein gemeinsames Verständnis für die Gestaltung der künftigen Rechtsvorschriften.   Die EZB unterstützt diese Initiative   Die EZB und das Eurosystem wirken an der Modernisierung und Integration der Zahlungs- und Abwicklungsinfrastrukturen sehr aktiv mit. Dies ist eine Grundlage für sichere und effiziente Finanzmärkte.      Ich hoffe, ich habe Sie davon überzeugen können, dass das Konzept der „Better Regulation“ eine gute Orientierung bei der Gestaltung der Regeln für den Finanzsektor bildet.      [1] S. Brok und R.

"4","“Built to Last”: The New Euro Area Framework   Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,Barclays Research Conference,London, 17 May 2013 Ladies and Gentlemen, The building we are in was bought by the Drapers’ Company from King Henry VIII in 1543. It has lived through turbulent times, from fires to conflicts - and, I should also say, various financial crises. But Drapers’ Hall has always recovered from the calamities it has faced. It has been rebuilt, renovated, enlarged and embellished. Thus, it was built to last – but has changed over the centuries. Today, I’d like to speak about a quite different building: the “new euro area framework”.  The euro area has been facing insufficiencies on several fronts, all at the same time. Let me be blunt: it has had governance shortcomings, stretched states, fragile banks, shrinking economies, sinking confidence in institutions and doubts about its integrity. Each of these difficulties has exacerbated the others; it has been a vicious circle. The crisis did not originate in the euro area, nor is it limited to it. But inside the euro area it has inflicted severe losses and pain, particularly on the younger generation.  Yet, in the euro area an unsuspected amount of repair is under way. The threat of a break-up has vanished since last summer. A new political economy is within reach. The foundations of a virtuous circle are already here. My message today is that the euro area is being rebuilt to last. Its foundations are being strengthened and new pillars and floors are being added. The euro area will remain both viable and beneficial to its citizens.  In the light of these testing circumstances, I would like to give some tentative answers – to four questions: Where do we stand? What are the strengths of the euro area? What’s next? What remains to be done? I will then offer some final remarks, and answer your questions.  Where do we stand? The European Central Bank has been in “crisis mode” for almost six years. The challenges for us have escalated in various stages. Allow me to recall them very briefly.    The first stage was the financial turmoil that erupted in August 2007 when the US sub-prime mortgage crisis started to unravel. [1] Globally, counterparty risks rose and confidence among market participants plummeted. This led to a drying-up of liquidity, and a sharp increase in risk premia.    The second stage of the crisis started in September 2008 after Lehman collapsed. Money markets froze, financial losses soared, bank deleveraging accelerated, and financial stress spilled over to the real economy. Trade and growth were hit hard. The ensuing global financial crisis gave rise to the great recession,  which affected European countries disproportionately due to their high degree of openness.    The even more serious third stage came in May 2010 when the euro area sovereign debt crisis erupted in Greece and spread to other countries.     What happened? After the launch of the euro, various cracks in the currency edifice emerged. Public finances were weak in several euro area countries; macro imbalances were persistent in others. Some countries experienced a boom in housing and construction and productivity growth was slow in others. The triggering event of the turmoil, on the other side of the Atlantic combined with the disappearance of “abundant money” exposed and deepened those fault lines. Several European economies became steadily weaker.  The underlying reasons were several: there were shortcomings in governance (both national and supranational), flaws in the design of the euro area, misjudgements by regulators and supervisors, and also insufficient scrutiny by financial market participants as well as by credit rating agencies. They did not sufficiently differentiate between borrowers. And I should not omit from this list the many economists who failed to see the systemic risks building up. The ensuing dysfunctional policy debate and the discordant national responses were also harmful. Understandably, national disaffection rose, as did scepticism about the euro area [2] - this is a phenomenon I know you are rather familiar with. Various doom-loops followed. The fates of governments and banks became ever more intertwined. Sovereigns had to recapitalise impaired domestic banks and support feeble domestic economies. In doing so, they accumulated extra debt. Perversely, even sound banks have been affected by the weakness of their home governments and domestic economies. Then, lower credit ratings and higher interest spreads of both banks and sovereigns pulled each other further down. This hurt the real economy and started a vicious circle that has been very difficult to stop and reverse. [3]  Banks across the euro area are now deleveraging and recapitalising, and the flow of credit is still hampered in several countries, mainly those in which households and firms are also trying to deleverage, while budget consolidation is under way. The functioning of the money market is severely impaired, credit is squeezed and the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is clogged.  The sovereign debt crisis came to a climax in mid-2012 when the risk of break-up seemed acute. Investors began shifting deposits away from banks in stressed jurisdictions, often to banks in countries where conditions were calmer. The deposit base fell in stressed countries. Correspondingly loan growth deviated greatly across the euro area. Small and medium-sized enterprises were, and still are, affected the most.  What has the ECB done? Over the last six years it has eased the credit squeeze, fought back against the economic slowdown, and countered financial fragmentation by slashing interest rates, flooding the banking sector with liquidity and lending widely. It took large scale conventional monetary policy measures to prevent deflation. Its unconventional measures prevented a meltdown of the financial system and aimed to restore the impaired transmission of monetary policy. Yet, credit flows remain weak and growth is still anaemic.    To sum up where we stand:  the sovereign debt crises of the euro area is a multi-layered affair: economic and financial imbalances plus failings of governance and flaws in institutional design, plus an erosion of trust and confidence. It’s an exceptionally complex situation. Five euro area countries are now undertaking EU/IMF adjustment programmes, while a few others are addressing imbalances outside a programme.  What are the strengths? Despite the depth of the crisis, the exceptional “flow and stock adjustments” under way, and ongoing financial market tensions, there are still some strong components supporting the building of the new euro area framework and holding things together.  The  first strength  is the resilience of the single market, which has steadily transformed the now deeply interconnected euro area economies. Companies and banks have a European perspective and reach. We are each other’s stakeholders. Economic integration is a diffuse process. It is the true engine of European integration and is generating largely benign effects. The single market represents the intrinsic value of the euro area. It is a common good. It is an asset shared by all its citizens – a fact which is not given enough recognition as a stabiliser during these difficult times.  The  second strength  lies in the solidity of our financial infrastructures: they have withstood the full force of the crisis. The Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET2), has enabled money market access throughout the crisis and for all countries: the cumulated imbalances are now steadily receding. In 1998 there were 18 large-value payment systems: that number fell to six in 1999 and now there are two, which means that both efficiency and financial stability have been enhanced. Central clearing counterparties (CCPs) for securities and derivatives declined from 13 in 1999 to nine in 2012. This entails greater efficiency gains by pooling activities. And more is coming. In 2008, the Single Euro Payments Area started to take effect due to time-lags. And the securities settlement systems will change radically once TARGET2-Securities becomes operational. This project is fully on track.  The   third strength  lies in the widespread acceptance of the need for adjustments and reforms in all dimensions of the crisis. The political authorities have taken action. They are already overhauling the political economy of the euro area, and establishing new governance to restore fiscal sustainability and prevent and correct macroeconomic imbalances. The Stability and Growth Pact has been tightened up by the so-called “six-pack” of economic governance measures, including the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (MIP), and they in turn have been complemented by the “two-pack”. Moreover, euro area countries are summoning up the courage to change – although it is painful in some regions. To quote Jean Monnet, one of the founding fathers of the European Union: “People will only accept changes under the pressure of necessity.” Indeed, change is under way in Europe. And the impressive political determination to reform together is not stopping at the national level. Also a  fourth strength  is that as a result of the crisis, a “crisis management and resolution framework” has emerged at the European level– and it is working. The initial stage was a fiscal backstop, the European Financial Stability Facility, and then the European Stability Mechanism. Confidence is slowly returning to both financial markets and high streets, even if growth and job prospects remain weak – the latter two being lagging indicators of the recovery under way. All this shows that European countries can turn themselves around.   To sum up the strengths:  the “repair work” on the euro area foundations is under way. Imbalances are slowly receding. Also there is the wide international circulation and relative strength of the euro as well as a stable demand for the euro as a reserve currency.  Yet, we are aware that deep reforms throughout the new framework are only as effective as they are completed, transposed, well explained, understood, adhered to, and given the time to display their effects. We know that we are not completely out of the woods.   So what’s next?  With the establishment of the ECB in June 1998 and the launch of the euro on 1 January 1999 monetary policy was centralised. Responsibility for the euro was entrusted to a strong and independent central bank. The ECB has fulfilled its primary objective of price stability. Fiscal policy, economic policies and supervision, however, have remained at national level. As this architecture has proved to be flawed, the respective Presidents of the European Council (Herman Van Rompuy), the European Commission (José Manuel Barroso), the Eurogroup (then Jean-Claude Juncker) and the ECB (Mario Draghi) drew up what is known as the “Four Presidents’ Report”. It advocates the completion of monetary union by way of an additional “four unions”.   These “four unions” are envisaged to mesh with each other, like cogwheels. The spin of one sets the others in motion. Conversely, when the momentum of one decreases the others follow suit. The banking union, the fiscal union, the economic union, and the political union [4] can transmit and reinforce the dynamics of European integration.  Let me elaborate on some key features of the banking union – a project with which I am closely associated. The fragmentation of the banking system along national lines has posed a direct threat to the integrity of the single currency. We need to break the doom-loop between sovereigns and banks, restore the confidence of depositors and investors – in fact rebuild trust in the whole financial system – as well as ease the reintegration of financial markets. The banking union will help to restore the proper transmission of monetary policy and relieve the ECB of some of the tasks undertaken during the crisis. Its importance and urgency cannot be overemphasised. The banking union comprises two main parts. One is the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), which is scheduled to start operating at the ECB in Frankfurt, at the earliest 12 months after the adoption of the regulation. The second part is the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), which is a Siamese twin. The ECB cannot exercise this task as it will undertake the analytical part of supervision. A separate authority is needed; perhaps one that is attached to the ESM, for the resolution task as it implies a distributional impact which belongs to the Executive prerogative. Still, close cooperation is warranted with the SSM and DG Competition.  What is also clear is that the resolution body needs to operate at the same level as the supervisor, i.e. the European level. This becomes even more obvious amid the potential need to deal with cross-border operating banks. The SSM will be a single supervisor for all banks established in the euro area, plus those banks established in the EU countries which have entered into a close cooperation with the ECB. So it will have a truly European focus.  It should create a level playing field for the European banking industry and remove any national biases or supervisory forbearance, and prevent the hiding of bad assets – or even leniency – towards so-called “national champions”, a phenomenon that might have become more acute during the crisis. It is a myth that such champions were in the interests either of domestic economies or of national taxpayers. But the SSM will go well beyond that: it will result in the elimination of asset and liability matching on a national level that has done so much harm.    How will the Single Supervisory Mechanism function in practice?   There will be a two-tier system of banks.  The banks considered to be systemically important, about 130 of them, will fall under the direct supervision of the ECB. But all other banks, while remaining under national supervision, will not be excluded from the ECB’s supervisory reach. In fact, national authorities will have to abide by ECB regulations, guidelines and general instructions. Hence, they will be subject to the ECB’s broad oversight mandate.  Yet the boundaries between the two tiers can also be adjusted if the need arises. [5] The ECB may decide at any time to exercise direct supervision over any other credit institutions. This will ensure the consistent application of supervisory standards as well as adherence to the guidelines and instructions issued by the ECB.  The ECB will be responsible for the functioning of the SSM. In practice, the ECB will rely heavily on existing national supervisors: their expertise and “proximity” to the supervised banks are essential for the SSM to be effective. No domestic aspect or concern must be overlooked. Even in the case of the systemic banks that will be directly supervised by the ECB, national supervisors will still be involved in on-site inspections. In fact, there will be joint supervisory teams.  The assignment of supervisory responsibilities to central banks mirrors the prevailing consensus among experts and academics. [6] There are many synergies between monetary policy and banking supervision, and in our case there are benefits from sharing micro and macro-information on monetary policy, bank supervision, and the oversight of payment systems. Moreover, an important lesson from the crisis is that there can be no price stability without financial stability. Most of the time, monetary policy and financial stability measures work in harmony. Still, there are concerns. There are several things we need to do, notably, steer clear of the risks, as the ECB will be the prime liquidity provider for these banks; establish clear safeguards against any potential conflicts of interest between the various ECB functions as they could give rise to reputational risks. And at the same time we need to reduce costs.  The SSM also represents a huge logistical challenge for the ECB. We are working hard on this and are well aware that the rewards may be considerable. It is requiring a lot of preparation at many levels including:   selecting highly skilled staff – many experts are already coming from national supervisory bodies;    drawing up the final list of systemically important banks that will be directly supervised;    harmonising reporting requirements; working out procedures that will govern the SSM’s relationship with national supervisors; and   preparing to review the quality of banks' assets, including legacy assets.    Let me add on the last point: Such a comprehensive assessment is needed before the SSM becomes operational. This could be organised in a coordinated endeavour where the workload is shared between by the centre and the national authorities. Calling upon external experts, under the strict control of the SSM, will increase the credibility of the balance sheet exercise because of the impartiality of third parties. Moreover, their expertise in certain areas will add great value. The scope of their involvement might not extent the significant banks, however. First coordination has already started with the European Banking Authority (EBA) which in the past looked upon the resilience of banks under stress scenarios. The SSM could undertake the asset quality review in the third quarter of this year until the first quarter of next year, and then in close cooperation with the EBA, conduct a stress test. This along with the balance sheet assessment will be a major component of the comprehensive assessment. The outcomes of the balance sheet assessment will also be an important input for the stress tests. The combined results of both exercises could be published by mid-2014, just before the SSM is scheduled to become operational.  As always in life, there is no such thing as a free lunch. The question arises: who will pay for financial stability and, above all, who will pay in the event of a banking resolution? There are two types of “costs”: operating costs incurred in normal times and losses sustained in times of crisis. As for the operating costs, European supervision will be financed by fees to be levied on banks. However, there will be efficiency gains from avoiding the duplication of services (national and European), so additional cost burdens for the financial industry will be contained.  What happens if a viable bank lacks capital? Such a bank, wherever it is based in the euro area, should first try to raise fresh capital from its shareholders or in the market. If it is unable to do so – for example due to unfavourable market conditions – fresh funding should be provided from a European recovery and resolution fund that is financed by all banks.  Such a fund should also help with resolution, for instance, to capitalise a bridge bank that is later sold on the market. Bailing-in of stakeholders will also play an increasing role to cover the cost of resolution. During the crisis we have seen the full spectre from mainly bailing-out banks with taxpayers’ money and bailing-in even depositors. A reliable framework is needed to guide investors and savers. Therefore, the pecking order of a broad scope of bail-in instruments needs to be defined. The list of exclusion should be limited. The Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) currently being negotiated should clarify in particular the positioning of unsecured depositors in the cascade. It is of crucial importance that an agreement on the BRRD is reached in a timely manner to have a resolution and recovery framework in place before the SSM starts operating. Only as a last resort should rescue funds be temporarily drawn from the ESM. To ensure fiscal neutrality, a loan to the European recovery and resolution fund should then be repaid ex post via levies on viable banks, and of course, the proceeds from the re-privatisation.  Another rationale for the SRM as a separate entity is that a supervisor cannot give objective verdicts on the viability of banks if then these banks can only be closed in a disorderly way. That, in turn, could trigger contagion and endanger financial stability. In other words, if banks cannot be resolved in a disciplined manner – known in advance and agreed upon – we could drift into supervisory forbearance, evergreening and zombification of companies as well as the banks themselves.  Hence, a resolution mechanism is essential for repairing financial markets. The capacity of the banking sector to absorb risks will increase, which is currently the bottleneck of loan provision to the real economy.   To sum up what’s next:  the banking union consisting of the SSM and the SRM will contribute to financial soundness, stability and resilience. All this would help to restore the proper transmission of monetary policy. The current very accommodative monetary policy stance could reach those it needs to reach unhampered. Correspondingly, the need for unconventional measures would diminish rather than increase. A single supervisor without a resolution counterpart, however, would push the central bank into ever more risk-taking to ensure financial stability, thus even threatening the independence of monetary policy.   What remains to be done?  The crisis has been – and still is – a wake-up call for the euro area. Initially, some stressed countries were largely in denial about the need to tackle their imbalances. Precious time was wasted, and that exacerbated the doom-loops. Then, things started turning around in mid-2010. A new political economy is within reach. But in the longer-term, what else do we need for the viability and prosperity of the euro area?  We need to firm up the progress on the fiscal union, the political union and the economic union. Several elements of the fiscal union are ready. I listed them a few minutes ago: they need to be transposed into national law, and adhered to at every level of government (i.e., national, regional, provincial and so on). Concerning “genuine political union”, our institutions also need to adjust to the higher level of integration that constitutes the monetary union. While on the intergovernmental EU wide level the Council has a counterpart on the euro area level, namely the euro group and the Euro Working Group, the executive arm of the supranational EU level, the Commission, and the legislator, the EU parliament, still lack an equivalent for the euro area. Yet, the principal building ground of the new euro area framework is the economic union. In the long term, we need euro area countries to become more flexible, open and to remain relatively synchronised. This would increase shock absorption, improve resource allocation, remedy the current heterogeneities, harmonise the transmission of monetary policies, and boost growth potential, thus enhancing the resilience of the euro area as a whole. This implies a need for deep changes in our societies. Allow me to point out that over the last few years the ECB has not only been a guardian of stability and among the most interested observers of the various deficit and imbalances procedures, but we have also raised awareness of the need for profound transformations in our political economy and in our societies. We have been advocates of change.  In my view, this is our most important unconventional measure, but it will never be able to replace the self-responsibility of countries.   In one respect, solving the sovereign debt crisis of the euro area remains a supremely national affair: namely, finding a consensus on, and domestic support for, new social contracts among all national constituencies. The new political economy of the euro area and the “four unions”, i.e., what we are calling the new euro area framework, can provide a sheltered environment for reforms and sustainable domestic social contracts.  In most of the stressed euro area countries this still requires tough choices across the generations and over time: e.g. education versus pension entitlements, infrastructure versus healthcare, research and development versus defence, and so on. Strengthening of tax administrations and treasury systems, expenditure control, privatisation will also be crucial. Reducing the costs of bureaucracy will matter more than ever across the euro area. There are varying needs for true innovation clusters à-la-Silicon Valley, as well as investments in scientific and technical education, research and development, encouragement of “angel investments”, and grassroots and sustainable banking. Labour markets need to become inclusive and fair in every country, while encouraging labour mobility, in particular in a monetary union. Greater competitiveness and sustainable growth of the whole euro area will then follow.   To sum up what still needs to be done: each euro area country needs to find its own trade-offs and support from its national constituencies. There might not be a single approach fitting all. No “pact” can force such transformation through, and no monetary policy measure – however unconventional – can replace it. Such “holistic” national therapies are inescapable: without them, no change in the euro area’s political economy and governance, or financing facility can be sustainable. The tensions and inequalities are clear for everyone to see: we can no longer postpone what should already have been addressed. The new euro area framework is an opportunity.   Some final remarks All currency unions evolve in their early years. Their institutions adapt to changing circumstances, as we saw for example in the US, and several federal states in Europe and even in the UK. The idea of Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) has evolved over decades. The euro area envisaged in the Werner Report of 1970 was ahead of its time, but planted important seeds. The Maastricht Treaty was a milestone and the most that Europe could have achieved 20-25 years ago, but that was not enough. There were various flaws in EMU’s design and governance. In retrospect, systemic risks were partly endogenous. We have learnt the hard way from our errors, and fortunately there are still a lot of strengths in Europe/euro area. The euro – and thus price stability and the future banking union – can provide a shield from outside shocks, secure the benefits of a credible world currency, and contribute to strengthening the single market and fostering internal stability. This structure would have been unimaginable only five or six years ago: yet it might not suffice unless it is accompanied by national reforms and new social contracts that in some cases have been postponed for decades. The new euro area framework is being rebuilt to be viable and to last.

"5","“Europe after the warm reboot”    Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Munich Seminars, Ifo Institute for Economic Research, University of Munich, 13 January 2014  Professor Sinn, Ladies and gentlemen, Almost 25 years have now past since the Berlin Wall came down. The fall of the Wall symbolised the collapse of the entire Eastern Bloc and the economic model in place there. The former “socialist” countries subsequently had to start from scratch. Gerlinde and Hans-Werner Sinn described the revitalisation of eastern Germany’s economy very fittingly when they chose “ Kaltstart” (Cold reboot) as the title of their book. Europe, too, came under immense pressure to take action as a result of the financial and government debt crisis. The case of the euro area, however, did not, and does not, call for a start from scratch. Nonetheless, extensive stabilisation measures, as well as both structural and institutional reforms, were necessary. Europe’s “warm reboot” took place almost four years ago. That makes this a good opportunity to take stock. Where does Europe stand today? What challenges lie ahead? That is what I would like to do here tonight, looking at the following three questions:   First, what has occurred at the institutional level?   Second, what can we make of the adjustments that have taken place in the Member States?   Third, what challenges do we still have to face?    A more stable institutional framework at the European level A stable monetary union calls for more than just a single monetary policy. The crisis has brought the weaknesses of the Maastricht Treaty painfully to light. First of all, the Member States failed to comply fully with agreed rules. For example, most of the euro area countries, starting with the largest ones, repeatedly breached the deficit ceilings set by the Stability and Growth Pact – and the community of sinners put up with it. Second, too little attention was paid to emerging macroeconomic imbalances. Third, expectations that the financial markets would ensure budgetary discipline on the part of Member States were sorely disappointed. Fourth, there was no institution in place that could intervene to stabilise the situation in a crisis. The crisis has caused all these weaknesses to be addressed. Both the institutional framework and the set of rules have been improved significantly: the Stability and Growth Pact has been strengthened through the adoption of the Fiscal Compact and what is known as the Six-pack. We now have a procedure in place for the early recognition and correction of excessive macroeconomic imbalances. The establishment of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) has given us an effective crisis management body. In the past, requirements alone proved incapable of satisfactorily resolving the problem of inadequate budgetary discipline because the Community tacitly accepted such breaches of the rules. That is why the new economic policy governance framework provides for quasi-automatic sanctions in the event of a Member State deviating from agreed benchmarks. *** It is not only the set of rules that has been improved and strengthened. A consensus was also reached on the need for a monetary union to be more highly integrated than a common market of independent states. The crisis has shown that wrong decisions on the part of individual Member States can have an impact on the EU as a whole. This has caused the President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy, together with the Presidents of the European Commission, the Eurogroup and the ECB, to propose putting in place the four elements of a true economic and monetary union: such a union should include not only a fiscal union and an economic union, but also a banking and political union. We are currently working hard to get a banking union off the ground. The goal of the envisaged banking union is to create a fully integrated, efficient and stable European financial market. Key to attaining that goal is an integrated banking market that will intensify competition for capital. That will result in a more efficient allocation of capital, thereby improving the financing conditions for enterprises. The enterprises, in turn, thereby gain the necessary financial leeway for investment that could have a favourable impact on economic growth. For us as a central bank, an integrated banking sector means, above all, that our monetary policy is fully effective throughout the euro area. This is the only way in which our monetary policy can have a proper impact on the real economy. Once the banking union and its two key elements – joint banking supervision and a joint bank resolution mechanism – are in place, they will help cut the close ties between bank and sovereign risks.  Structural adjustment in the euro area While the euro area has been busy with the reform of its institutional framework, macroeconomic imbalances there have diminished considerably. This is reflected, no least, in the improved current account balances of countries that were hit particularly hard by the crisis. Taken together, those countries already recorded a small current account surplus back in 2012. There is reason to assume that the underlying adjustments have largely been structural in nature. Put simply, current account deficits can be reduced through two channels: either domestic demand falls in comparison with external demand (expenditure shifting), or there is a decline in the real effective exchange rate (expenditure switching). Prior to the crisis, there were some euro area countries that had a current account deficit and, at the same time, consumed more than they were producing. Typically, an economy will again record a current account balance that is in line with economic fundamentals, and will be able to exploit its production potential in full, when both overall domestic demand and real exchange rates decline. Prices often adjust only slowly. Moreover, in a monetary union, the countries involved cannot change the nominal exchange rate of their currency unilaterally. Any short-term adjustment of the current account thus takes place via the demand side. That has unpleasant side-effects: actual production falls below the production potential, meaning that the country concerned has a negative output gap, and unemployment rises. In order to bring the internal and external balances back into line with one another, it is essential that the real effective exchange rate is reduced. This form of internal adjustment makes domestic products more attractive and fosters economic growth by way of higher net exports. It also means that a stronger focus on internationally tradable goods and services results in adjustment that is more conducive to growth. The improvements in the current account balances of the “crisis countries” have indeed been due to a mix of declining domestic demand and real depreciation. Initially in the foreground in these countries was a painful decline in demand. In the meantime, however, the Member States concerned are gradually becoming more competitive again. In Spain, for instance, the real effective exchange rate has fallen by almost 15% since the fourth quarter of 2007. The country has climbed from 42nd to 35th place on the World Economic Forum’s global ranking of countries’ competitiveness. Since 2011, Portugal’s share of exports in GDP has increased by 11 percentage points, while that of Spain has risen by 8 percentage points. In Ireland, the share of exports in GDP has increased by around 25 percentage points since 2008. It was only initially that Ireland’s imports declined slightly – they are now already higher than the level prior to the crisis. These developments show that adjustment is indeed possible, even within a monetary union. But just how sustainable are these adjustments? Might they not be merely short-term developments due to the weakness of business activity in the countries concerned? The improvements in the current accounts of the crisis countries are primarily structural in nature. What is involved is thus not an only temporary drop in domestic demand. That is why, viewed from today’s perspective, we regard the improvements to be sustainable. Although the current account positions of the crisis countries could again change slightly once output there is back into line with the production potential, it is unlikely that the adjustments recorded to date will be reversed in full. Better current account balances do not mean, however, that the crisis has been overcome. And it certainly does not mean that there is nothing left to do. The level of unemployment, especially that of young people, is depressingly high in many countries. This calls for further structural reforms, although some progress has already been made in this field. The OECD [1] has found that the labour markets in Portugal, Spain and Greece are now more flexible than those in the so-called “core countries”. In Greece, for instance, far-reaching labour market reforms have significantly reduced the cost of labour, and have thus improved the country’s price competitiveness. Since 2009, labour costs there have fallen by some 18%, with wage and salary adjustments the main driver of developments. Specifically, compensation per employee has decreased by around 20% over the period in question. Labour market reforms can also strengthen the growth potential and increase prosperity. That can, of course, also lead to higher demand for imported goods and services. At the same time, however, improved labour market fundamentals ensure that the countries concerned become more competitive again. That, in turn, can help prevent current account deficits from rising excessively once economic activity in these countries regains proper momentum. It is precisely in this area – in the still very tentative economic recovery – that I see the greatest challenge to be faced this year. Europe’s political leaders have learnt from the crisis. They have strengthened the institutional framework and have set a deepening of European integration in motion. And Member States are becoming more and more competitive. However, the economic recovery in Europe continues to be rather fragile.  The challenge: productive investment for more growth Lastingly overcoming the crisis demands a return to sustainable economic growth in Europe. That calls for productive investment. Since the beginning of 2008, the main reason for declining growth has been the lack of investment in the euro area. Even the slight recovery in economic activity between 2009 and 2011 saw an only barely discernible increase in investment. Although it is quite normal for investment levels to vary, the decline in investment over the past five years was perceptibly sharper and continued far longer than in any recession in the euro area in the past 30 years. Why is the investment ratio currently so low? Some businesses have reduced their investment because their sales and earnings prospects are muted. The macroeconomic environment is occasionally bleak and some sectors are in the midst of restructuring. All this makes planning increasingly uncertain. Other businesses regard further investment as unnecessary because they have adequate spare production capacity at their disposal. Both banks and businesses need to reduce their, in some cases, excessive debt and are shrinking their balance sheets accordingly. That, too, reduces investment activity. Some enterprises simply lack the funds they need for investment. Their possibilities for obtaining financing are inadequate. These are all cyclical phenomena. Apart from them, structural changes may result in lower investment at home. Examples in this respect are ageing societies with poor macroeconomic performance. In addition, the trend towards an outsourcing of production is also leaving its mark. And finally, consumption patterns are changing. For instance, the importance of cars as status symbol is on the decline. *** Although by far most investment is undertaken by enterprises, the political domain determines the fundamentals that create a favourable climate for investment. Even enterprises that can actually afford to spend money tend to limit their investment in times of political and economic uncertainty. Moreover, public sector investment in key areas such as education and infrastructure add to the attractiveness of an economic location. Such investment improves conditions for production, and thus also attracts new private sector investors. In times marked by consolidation and the reduction of debt levels, however, this cannot be taken for granted. That is why it is all the more important, first, that those countries that have the financial leeway necessary for investment keep an eye on infrastructure needs and, second, that regulatory bodies do not raise barriers against, in particular, long-term investment projects undertaken by public and private sector partnerships. In Europe, political and economic uncertainty has already diminished. The currently more stable macroeconomic environment there probably also owes something to the policy pursued by the ECB. We at the ECB will continue to do whatever we can within the scope of our mandate to eliminate any uncertainty.   Where monetary policy is concerned, this includes the reaffirmation by the Governing Council of its forward guidance, through which the planning security of market participants was increased by indicating that we continue to believe that the ECB’s policy interest rates will remain at their current or a lower level for a longer period of time.   With respect to the forthcoming assessment of the balance sheets or stress tests of the most significant banks in the euro area, we intend to publish details of the methodology at the end of this month.   It remains a task of the political domain to further reform the labour markets, to consolidate the public sector budgets in a sustainable manner, to make the judiciary more efficient and to reduce unnecessary bureaucracy. Complex and partially unclear insolvency proceedings may, for instance, have the effect of deterring investment. In this respect, I certainly see room for improvement: in addition to greater transparency, out-of-court settlements should also be provided for. Moreover, I would regard early-warning systems and a speedier conclusion of judicial proceedings as feasible. All this can contribute to making a location more attractive to investors. In order to ensure that the recovery of investment activity subsequently gains proper momentum, it is essential that enterprises have adequate financing at their disposal. In times marked by fragmented European financial markets, this is not always easy. Bottlenecks in obtaining financing are an issue for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in particular. And such enterprises play an important role in Europe’s economy: 99.7% of all European enterprises fall into this category. They account for around 60% of all jobs in the euro area. Given the economic importance of SMEs in the euro area, their provision with adequate financing is a key element of ensuring a sustainable recovery of economic activity in the euro area. These small and medium-sized enterprises obtain most of their financing from the banking sector. Direct access to the capital market is rare. That is why it is vital for the European banking sector to be restored to health. Only if this is done will banks again be able to pursue their core business and provide the real economy with credit. The establishment of a banking union will contribute to making the banking sector more sound. In preparation of the single supervisory mechanism, we are conducting a comprehensive analysis of the most significant banks in the euro area. In the event of our revealing weaknesses in this exercise, the banks concerned will have to take measures to correct them. Banks with sound business models, which will be supervised on the basis of harmonised European requirements, should be capable of providing the real economy with loans for productive investment. The fact that European banks are increasingly again gaining access to the international capital markets is a good sign in this respect. The banking union is aimed at the establishment of a single European capital market. It marks the attempt to re-integrate the fragmented European market more closely again. If that proves to be successful, enterprises will be able to raise a loan from a bank in a neighbouring country, rather than from its home country bank, whenever better terms and conditions offered there. Enterprises would then again be assessed in terms of the creditworthiness, rather than – as is currently the case – on the basis of their location. A healthy, integrated banking sector is thus of significance. In addition, however, alternative sources of financing should be considered as well. For smaller enterprises in particular, it is usually difficult to raise capital directly on the market. This is due, inter alia, to the fact that their financial situation is generally less transparent than that of larger corporations. That makes it difficult or more costly for investors to obtain adequate information for reasoned investment decisions. A single database with information of the credit risk of SMEs would reduce the transaction costs of both investors and the enterprises themselves. Such a database might also contain other information provided on a voluntary basis. In those countries in which this has not already been done, the national central banks might consider putting in place an internal system for the assessment of SMEs’ creditworthiness. That might also make it feasible to give interested third parties access to those credit scores. However, it is also possible to indirectly facilitate small and medium-sized enterprises’ access to the capital market. That would require a revitalisation of the securitisation market that has virtually dried up in Europe. The reputation of asset-backed securities (ABSs) has been bad ever since the problems with mortgage-backed securities in the United States. However, there were hardly any defaults on securitisations in Europe. Between mid-2007 and the first quarter of 2013, the default rate on securitisations in the EU was only around 1.4%, while that in the United States was 17.4% over the same period. [2] That should be acknowledged by the regulatory authorities who should adjust and harmonise the equity capital requirements accordingly. Robust European securitisation platforms could provide a sensible complement to bank-based financing. Analogous to the German market for borrowers’ note loans, other Member States, too, might attempt to establish a regime for the private placement of securities in order to provide SMEs with further alternative ways of raising financing. To this end, common and standardised regulatory and accounting methodologies would be good to have. Unfortunately, fragmented structures can also be found in the field of public sector support measures. Possible counteraction on the part of the political domain might be to encourage development banks such as Germany’s Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) or its Spanish counterpart, the Instituto de Crédito Oficial (ICO), to engage in cross-border business, which would demand that the statutes of development banks be amended accordingly in some cases. In addition, national development banks might coordinate their activities more closely with the European Investment Bank (EIB) and also increase their cooperation with one another. For example, they could exchange information on successful approaches and develop a set of tools for appropriate financial instruments. If the political domain ensures that fundamentals are attractive and if sound enterprises again have the possibility to raise adequate financing, the basic prerequisites would be given to allow industry to invest again. If the investment involved is productive investment, this would help to consolidate the tentative economic recovery in the euro area.  Concluding remarks That brings me to the end of my deliberations today. Europe’s economy is gradually recovering from a phase of stagnation. Adjustment is taking place not only at the European level, but also in every single Member State. The progress made in the so-called crisis countries, in particular, shows that macroeconomic adjustment can indeed be successful even in a monetary union. Such processes, however, take time and can be painful at times. The challenge in 2014 and beyond remains the further development of the Economic and Monetary Union. That means creating the prerequisites for sustainable growth, which includes improving the climate for investment and making it structurally easier for SMEs to raise bank loans and access the capital market. If we succeed in this, Europe could emerge from the crisis stringer than it was before.

"6","“Monetary policy and the euro area problem”   Speech by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, at the 18th Euro Finance Week, Frankfurt, 16 November 2015  ***   The speech points that the euro area problem is part of a predicament shared by other advanced economies: decades of declining economic and productivity growth rates, prolonged periods of low inflation and an untamed financial sector fuelling asset price booms. Policies adopted by the ECB are thus responding to the present situation of low inflation and tepid recovery. Namely, the low level of policy rates is associated with the declining real rate of equilibrium. The worsening of the international economic situation and the low inflation will lead the ECB to reassess its policy stance in December. To face the challenges confronting the euro area, it is recognised that monetary policy cannot address all the problems and that structural reforms and fiscal policy should help to overcome them.    ***  Ladies and Gentlemen, I am honoured by Mr Maleki’s invitation to speak at the Opening Conference of the 18th Euro Finance Week.  In my remarks today I would like to characterise the current economic situation in the euro area. Furthermore, I will address the roles that monetary policy, supply-side reforms and fiscal policies have played – and can play in the future – in shaping this situation.  The current economic situation in the euro area The euro area challenges are part of a predicament shared by other advanced economies: decades of declining economic and productivity growth rates, prolonged periods of low inflation and an untamed financial sector fuelling asset price booms. This constitutes a very challenging situation that cannot be solved by one policy area alone, be it monetary policy or any other. Furthermore, issues in the euro area are more acute than in the case of other advanced economies. Since 2008, the euro area has experienced a deep recession, a quickly interrupted recovery, another long, mild recession, and finally a slow recovery. Euro area GDP per capita at the end of this year is expected to be 1.6 percent below what it was seven years ago, at the end of 2008. Notably, growth outcomes in several member states have been much worse than this disappointing average. At the end of 2015, GDP per capita in Italy is projected to be 10.1 percent lower than seven years before; 4.2 percent lower in Spain; 3.4 percent lower in the Netherlands and 8.5 percent lower in Finland. [1] At the aggregate level, the euro area output is now 20 percent below the level it would have achieved had the trend growth in the previous 15 years continued after 2007. Admitting that the economy would grow from now on at that same trend, the accumulated loss of output until 2030, properly discounted, would represent more than three times the whole output of 2008. The crisis left a permanent economic loss with broad scars in our societies.  This is evident when looking at unemployment data. The unemployment rate in the euro area, as a whole, stood at 7.5 percent on the eve of the financial crisis, in 2007. Unemployment increased steadily in subsequent years, reaching about 12 percent of the labour force in 2013, and has since come down only slowly, by one percentage point, to 11 percent. Disaggregated by countries, the range of unemployment rates goes from 4.5 to 25 percent. If we were to add the number of part-time workers preferring to hold a full-time job and of those discouraged to look for a job, (figures also published by Eurostat), the real situation would be undoubtedly grimmer. In spite of recent increases, total employment is still 3.3 million people below the pre-crisis period. High unemployment is destabilizing our continent and challenging our social and political systems.  In the environment of weak economic activity, the euro area has been experiencing downward pressures on inflation. As you know, the Governing Council has defined the price stability objective of the ECB as a year-on-year rate of growth of the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of “below, but close to, 2 percent.” The annual rate of inflation measured in terms of the HICP has decreased year after year, since 2011. Inflation ran at 0.4 percent in 2014 and is forecast to be 0.1 percent in 2015. As I will discuss, the Governing Council has undertaken a number of measures to prevent inflation from falling further and to make sure that inflation returns to the level consistent with price stability over the medium-term. In part as a result of these measures, the latest ECB staff projection sees the annual rate of inflation increasing to 1.1 percent next year and to 1.7 percent in 2017, though, again, these forecasts are subject to revision, in particular due to the recent adverse news about the external environment of the euro area. All member states have been experiencing downward pressures on inflation. Inflation ran at 0.8 percent last year in Germany, and is forecast to be only 0.2 percent this year. The analogous numbers for Italy, to take another example, are only somewhat lower, 0.2 percent and 0.1 percent respectively. The low inflation rates reflect a continued sluggish recovery in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Numerous reasons can be considered as root causes for this dismal performance. Next to recent declines in oil prices, the combination of low inflation and low growth essentially points to a lack of demand holding back the recovery. A question frequently posed regards the reasons for the ECB’s Governing Council not to accept the low increase in prices which, at first glance, appear beneficial to people. There are several reasons why excessively low inflation generates relevant risks for the economy and thus to everyone. First, with monetary policy rates at their lower bound, lower inflation rates imply higher real interest rates; in particular, the real interest rate may end up above the equilibrium value needed to match savings and investment at the full employment level. Second, very low inflation may lead to an un-anchoring of inflation expectations. This would imply second-round effects on price and wage setting protracting the subdued price developments into the future. Third, low inflation increases the debt burden of borrowers, obstructing the needed balance sheet adjustment of highly indebted households, firms and governments. Fourth, should a generalised deflation pressure prevail, nominal rigidities in the economy, and particularly in labour markets, could inhibit the needed relative price adjustments. Finally, empirical studies show that there is a positive measurement bias in the measurement of price developments, which implies that a zero inflation rate would mask actually declining prices. For all these reasons the ECB has decided a quantitative objective with an inflation rate for the euro area of below but close to 2 percent. This objective guarantees an appropriate buffer to counter the above-mentioned drawbacks of very low inflation or even deflationary tendencies. [ 1]  The monetary policy measures adopted by the ECB In order to bring inflation rates closer to the stated objective of price stability over the medium-term, and in order to support the aggregate recovery, our monetary policy continues pursuing its accommodative stance. Our main policy rates will stay low for a prolonged period of time, in line with our forward guidance. The asset purchase programme will keep our balance sheet expanding until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation. When the global financial crisis intensified in September 2008, the interest rate on the ECB’s main refinancing operations for banks stood at 4.25 percent. By May 2009, the ECB had reduced this rate to 1 percent, while simultaneously cutting the rate on the deposit facility to 25 basis points. The significant decline of inflation since the later part of 2013 led us to further reduce interest rates during last year and the interest rate on the main refinancing operations currently stands at 5 basis points, whereas the interest rate on the deposit facility is -20 basis points. Why did the Governing Council reduce the policy rates to such low levels? Policy rates are defined in nominal terms, they have a component related to inflation and another associated to real economic growth. Monetary policy searches for a neutral rate that steers the economy to stable inflation around its target and consequentially, the market for goods and services in equilibrium at full employment. The interest rate in real terms, i.e., adjusted by inflation, is precisely the rate at which the economy’s growth rate is equal to the potential growth rate so that no demand pressure makes the inflation rate inconsistent with price stability in the medium-term. Recent estimates for the U.S. indicate that such real rate can now be in negative territory and the same should apply to other advanced economies. [2]  The point that monetary policy cannot affect the equilibrium real rate is important. In addition to the propensity to save, the equilibrium rate depends on the growth rate of potential output. If potential output grows slowly, the equilibrium rate will be low, and therefore the real rate necessary to achieve price stability will also be low, independently of what the central bank does. Unfortunately, the growth rate of potential output in the advanced economies appears to have decreased in the recent years. Labour productivity, defined as output per employee, grew at the same average annual rate of 1.7 percent in the euro area and in the U.S. for two decades, from 1981 to 2000. From 2001 to 2008, the average annual growth rate of labour productivity in the U.S. was lower, at 1.5 percent, and since 2008 it has been only 1.1 percent. The slowdown in growth of labour productivity in the euro area has been far more pronounced: the average annual growth rate of labour productivity dropped to 0.5 percent from 2001 to 2008 and stands at 0.2 percent since then. Demographic factors also matter for the equilibrium real rate. In an ageing society in which a large fraction of the population is saving for retirement, the propensity to save tends to be high and therefore, the rate of return on savings will be low, independently of monetary policy. In this context, it is important to realize that the working-age population of the European Union and the working-age population of the euro area has been falling since 2012, and this decline is expected to continue. [3] Note that the central bank cannot affect the equilibrium real rate. The equilibrium real rate depends on features such as the households’ propensity to save, and the central bank cannot influence this. The ECB did not lead to this environment with underlying negative real equilibrium rates.  The ECB responded to the decline of the real equilibrium rate by reducing the policy rates, and consequently the real rates declined throughout the economy. Had the policy rates been cut less aggressively, real income and inflation would have been even lower today. Now think about the implications for retirement saving by an average household, had the ECB reduced rates less aggressively. The real interest rate would have been higher, but the household’s income would have been lower. Therefore, the amount that the household would have saved for retirement would probably have been smaller – not larger – than with the current, low ECB policy rates.  The other point related to savers is that any economic reasoning related to income must be done in real terms. This implies for instance, that in 2007 deposit interest rates in Germany where little more than 2percent but inflation was higher and so real deposits were negative, i.e., depositors were losing purchasing power. In fact, the Bundesbank wrote in 2014, “As it happens, negative real interest rates have been the norm, rather than the exception, over recent decades”. [4] Recently, deposits have been around zero but the latest inflation rate is at 0.2 percent while real interest rates are even slightly above their levels of 2014. Nominal interest rates can only increase when our policies become successful in the medium-term and inflation is closer to our official target.  In addition to pursuing interest rate policy, the ECB has adopted a number of non-standard monetary policy measures since 2008, including a large scale asset purchase programme, targeting an improvement in financial conditions. The goal of our current monetary policy stance is to incentivise economic risk-taking, in the form of better financing conditions for households and firms. We are, of course, very much aware that side effects are also present, in particular in the form of excessive asset valuations or excessive risk-taking by market participants.  We are following these developments very closely, notably in relation to risks posed by asset valuations and the search for yield phenomenon. Our assessment at present, monitoring a range of asset markets, is that there are no signs of generalised overvaluations in the euro area. At the same time, the banking sector is more resilient, with higher capital ratios, and financial stability conditions are currently fulfilled in spite of the existent risks.  The external environment of the euro area has deteriorated since the asset purchase programme began. In particular, concerns about growth prospects in emerging markets and unfavourable developments in financial and commodity markets have signalled downside risks to the outlook for growth and inflation, relative to the latest ECB staff projection from September. Headline inflation is again at zero and core inflation has not consolidated a more positive development, which points to the need to reassess our policy stance in order to achieve our goals by 2017. Eurosystem staff is currently analysing the impact of the recent external events on the euro area, in particular on the speed of adjustment of the inflation rate to levels consistent with price stability. The next Eurosystem staff forecast, due in December, will help the Governing Council re-examine whether the current degree of monetary accommodation remains appropriate. Further monetary policy options are available should the Council determine that changes to the current policy stance are required.   The role of other economic policies  Allow me now to turn to the role of other economic policies. The transmission mechanism from monetary policy decisions to inflation involves the real economy. With a negative output gap there is a “divine coincidence“ between the objective of normalising inflation and that of expanding aggregate demand to reduce the slack in the economy and put pressure on prices. Accordingly, the accommodative monetary policy stance of the ECB has supported and will continue to support real activity. Nevertheless, it has to be acknowledged that monetary policy cannot do it alone. Given how weak the economic performance of the euro area has been in the recent years, coupled with the limitations of monetary policy in what is called a “liquidity trap”, it is critical that supply-side reforms and fiscal policies contribute to improve the euro area’s growth prospects. Supply-side reforms are vital because the long-term growth rate depends on the productivity of labour and capital. Supply-side reforms can increase productivity, thereby lifting the potential growth rate. Growth friendly reforms include policy actions to improve the business environment, to foster competition, to improve public infrastructure and education. Policies that reduce structural unemployment and raise the labour force participation rate are also important so that European firms make full use of the amount of labour available. Demographic policies can play a role too, so that the supply of labour in Europe can grow, rather than shrink, in the future. In recent years, much of the reform effort within the euro area appears to have taken place in the member states most adversely affected by the global financial crisis and its aftermath. The OECD recently assessed structural reform efforts and achievements since 2011. It classified Estonia, Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain as the most successful reformers among all OECD members. [5] The Netherlands and Germany have been laggards in the OECD ranking, even if starting from comfortable positions.  While supply-side reforms are desirable, their objective is typically growth in the long-run. As such, supply-side reforms normally take time to produce positive effects. Furthermore, in the short-run, reforms can dampen aggregate expenditure, when they require costly adjustments up front, as has been recognised in the Stability and Growth Pact. For this reason and amid a tepid recovery, it is important for member states’ fiscal policy to be as accommodative as possible. Fiscal policy and to some extent, income policy, have room for manoeuvre whenever an economy is running a current account surplus. This is the case for the euro area that currently has a surplus of 3percent of GDP and is projected to remain as such the next few years. The surplus was only 0.1 percent in 2007 at the peak of the cycle, and will reach USD 365 billion this year. This is quite high by historical standards, it is now higher than China´s surplus at USD 329 billion. In my view, a pure economic reflection is warranted. This big increase in the surplus took place while the unemployment rate increased from 7.5 percent to 12 percent standing now at 11 percent and while employed population is down by 3.3 million people compared with 2007 figures. In the U.S., employment deserves a higher priority for well-known historical reasons. Levels of employment have already surpassed those of 2007 while the external current account shows a deficit of USD 460 billion.  Economically, a surplus means that domestic savings are higher than investment or, seen from another angle, that domestic expenditure is lower than what the domestic economy produces. From an international perspective, a surplus means that the economy is importing demand from other countries that are necessarily running a deficit. As a consequence, it means that the economy is absorbing and reducing world demand. What is also important to grasp is that this is a macroeconomic phenomenon and that total savings of an economy are not just the result of individual preferences and behaviour but the end result of a whole set of macroeconomic policies —from tax and fiscal to monetary or income policy. The macroeconomic policies of one economy affect the savings or expenditure of other countries. Trade and finance link all economies in a specific way. Not all economies can have a surplus. The relation between savings and investment or expenditure and domestic production is not unilaterally determined.  What all these economic points imply is that an economy that has a surplus can adopt macroeconomic policies to increase domestic demand, either by income policy or by using its fiscal space to cut taxes or increase expenditure, while still keeping the basic macroeconomic equilibrium of not spending more than what it produces. The points I made provide the rationale for the statement made last year in Der Spiegel by the Bundesbank´s Chief Economist, welcoming the then “recently agreed pay rises above 3 percent”. [6]  The surplus situation also means that, for the euro area as a whole, there is fiscal space to be used to help closing the existent output gap resulting from lack of demand. This would put upward pressure on prices, speeding up the path towards normalisation.  It is crucial to note again that this is about macroeconomic policy and not about microeconomic efficiency. It is definitely not about asking our economies to compromise productivity and competitiveness. It is about fostering a broader use in the present of what a productive economy can sustain.  The problem is that there is no common European fiscal policy, which is also not foreseen in the Treaty. The overall fiscal stance is not discussed and there is no substantive effort to co-ordinate independent national fiscal policies. Many economists have pointed out that this constitutes a significant shortcoming of our monetary union design. Economic governance of the monetary union depends only on monetary policy without any concept of a macroeconomic policy mix.  This shortcoming provides the rationale for the proposal in the recent Five Presidents’ Report, that points for the creation of “an euro area-wide fiscal stabilisation function” in the longer term.  On the way to the “longer term”, one could envisage some steps to strengthen the European dimension of fiscal policy in the Eurogroup. Another initiative could be to expand the financial capacity of the Juncker Plan in order to really help to jump start investment at the level of the European Union. This would be consistent with the existent overall fiscal space.  A last important remark is that a more flexible overall fiscal policy does not require changing the existing framework of the Stability and Growth Pact that binds euro area Member States. As recently emphasised in a document by the European Commission, [7] the Pact already envisages a certain degree of flexibility in the way its rules should be applied. One example is the notion of “structural budget balance” which Member States are obliged to meet. The structural budget balance is, in effect, the budget balance corrected for the effects of the business cycle. The objective of the correction is to allow fiscal policy to play its role in mitigating possible economic shocks. The scope of flexibility within the Stability and Growth Pact should thus be exploited in full.  Let me conclude.  The euro area has been experiencing a protracted period of low inflation and weak economic activity, with two recessions and a very slow recovery since the latter recession. Monetary policy has been and will continue to be accommodative, but monetary policy alone cannot respond to all the existing challenges. Recent developments only add to the urgency of addressing economic, social and demographic problems of the euro area. No complacency with mass unemployment should be tolerated.  Outcome legitimacy is, at present, the main source of legitimacy for the European project. The euro area must deliver on its promises of stable prosperity, knowing that societies do not live in the long-term but in the here and now. The task requires new institutional reforms and a sense of unity. As Helmut Schmidt wrote in 2011, we should “strive to ensure that the historically unique European Union emerges unshaken and with self-confidence from its current period of weakness”.

"7","“What has Europe learnt from the crisis”?   Speech by José Manuel González-Páramo, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, OMFIF Conference: On the cusp: The world economy at a turning point. Strengthening stability at a time of challenge and change.Frankfurt am Main, 15 March 2012  The euro area’s “missing institutions” From its conception the euro was and has been a unique and ambitious project. It combined a centralised monetary policy with decentralised economic policies, and to paraphrase Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, created a currency that did not belong to a single nation-state. A key finding for the euro area, arising from the crisis, is that this construction was not complete. In particular, the euro area did not have certain institutions we associate with political federations and that act as shock-absorbers against the negative effects of imbalances. The key lesson from the crisis, therefore, is that the euro area needs to compensate for these “missing institutions” by establishing a much stronger economic and financial union. A central area where the absence of shock-absorbing institutions has been felt is via intra-euro area current account imbalances. These imbalances existed for many years prior to the crisis, but were largely ignored as theory told us that they could always be financed through cross-border financial flows. However, it is now clear that current account imbalances – while not being the only proximate causes of the crisis – are not benign and imply vulnerabilities which can be transmitted to the euro area as a whole.  On the financial side of the current account, persistent intra-area imbalances imply that some public or private sectors are living beyond their means, year after year. If, as was the case in some euro area countries, these imbalances are also linked to the large build-up of external liabilities by an over-leveraged domestic banking system that engages in excessive risk taking, this may also create the conditions for the kind of twin sovereign-bank crises which we have witnessed over the recent period. Private liabilities can quickly become sovereign ones when governments are required to recapitalise banks or guarantee bank funding, leading to sovereign debt crises. At the same time, sovereign liabilities can undermine domestic banking sectors given the high exposure of euro area banks to their own governments’ debt and the link made by markets of the cost of funding of banks with that of their respective sovereign.  Such negative effects may potentially be better mitigated in political federations given their stronger shock-absorbing institutions. For example, if a particular state in the U.S. were to experience a build-up in private sector liabilities that threatened its local banks, the responsibility for recapitalisation and deposit insurance would fall on the federal government – through institutions like the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. This means that a U.S. state cannot be brought into financial difficulties by a mismatch between the size of its banking sector and that of its local economy, whereas a euro area country can – as we saw in Ireland. On the real side of the current account, persistent trade imbalances within the euro area also reflect accumulated competitiveness losses in deficit countries. The problem may be masked while growth is driven by credit and consumption, as was the case in some euro area countries before 2008. But when there is a reversal in financial flows and foreigners are no longer willing to finance the further accumulation of external debt, accrued competitiveness losses come to the fore. This can result in particular regions suffering sustained low growth and unemployment.  Again, these negative effects may be more manageable with the shock-absorbing institutions of a political federation. A homogenous language and culture may facilitate labour mobility, providing one channel for adjustment – although recent evidence suggests this effect is not as significant in the U.S. as previously thought. At the same time, having a large federal budget creates a natural stabiliser as federal spending on “big ticket” items like social security, healthcare and defence redistributes incomes between rich and struggling regions.  Constructing a sui generis response It is clear that the way ahead for the euro area cannot involve trying to construct the institutions of a political federation overnight. This implies that the euro area needs a different approach to ensure the smooth functioning of monetary union that can compensate for some of these “missing institutions”. This approach has two main pillars. The first pillar is to strengthen fundamentally the governance procedures which prevent imbalances from arising. With fewer shock-absorbing institutions to mitigate crises when they arise, the euro area has learned that it must become more effective at preventing imbalances. This process has involved tightening the rules for fiscal policies and creating a much needed framework to monitor broader macroeconomic imbalances and competitiveness. On the fiscal side, the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact and the new Fiscal Compact are specifically designed to catch imbalances earlier. A key focus of the SGP reform was to strengthen the so-called “preventive arm” – for example, sanctions are now possible for non-compliance with medium-term budgetary objectives. The Fiscal Compact supports this focus on prevention by creating a new “first line of defence”: balanced budget rules with a constitutional status. Importantly, this shifts the onus for enforcement away from Brussels and onto national institutions, encouraging greater ownership. Indeed, if applied properly, this Fiscal Compact would correct imbalances before the EU level rules ever need to be activated. On the broader macroeconomic side, the new Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure allows for early monitoring of – amongst other things – competitiveness trends, private sector credit flows and house prices. If excessive imbalances show up in these areas, sanctions [1] can be applied to euro area countries that do not follow recommendations to correct them. Under this framework, the kinds of credit booms and competitiveness losses we witnessed in the first years of the euro would be “flashing red” much earlier. I am aware that some criticise this process as asymmetric. While it is clear that the vulnerabilities created by large current account deficits are greater than those of surpluses – and therefore require more urgent remedies – the structural drivers of current account imbalances in surplus countries are also partly being addressed, even if not to the same extent as those in deficit countries. In parallel to the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure, for example, the Commission intends to undertake further analysis on the drivers and possible policy implications of large sustained current account surpluses, including trade and financial linkages between surplus and deficit countries. It will also examine ways for further rebalancing current account imbalances, particularly at the level of the euro area, and within the global context. A key theme of the crisis response has also been a renewed focus on structural reforms as embedded in the Euro Plus Pact and Europe 2020 Strategy, which apply to all participating Member States equally. It would be naïve, however, to believe that with better governance crises could always be prevented. The second pillar to compensate for the euro area’s “missing institutions”, therefore, is to strengthen the way in which the euro area as a whole manages crises. Having witnessed how imbalances in one euro area country – no matter how small - can become systemic and create financial obligations for other taxpayers, the EU institutions, national governments and national parliaments are now playing a much stronger role in demanding and monitoring economic reforms. This shift is visible in much more active role of the euro area Heads of State or Government in the economic management of the euro area – now institutionalised in the form of the Euro Summit. It is also visible in the greater scrutiny applied by national parliaments to the economic policies of other Member States: for example, to approve financial assistance programmes a number of national parliaments now require EU-IMF compliance reports and debt sustainability analyses. This changing role of national parliaments underscores the recent observation by Herman Van Rompuy that national parliaments are increasingly EU institutions. The Commission is also gaining a much stronger crisis management through the new “two pack” legislation. The current proposals would allow the Commission to put any Member State under enhanced surveillance if it is experiencing or threatened with financial difficulties – regardless of whether it has requested financial assistance. This would imply stress tests of the banking sector by the EBA, monitoring of macro imbalances and regular review missions by the Commission in liaison with the ECB. Moreover, the Commission would be able to send back budgets that did not comply with the SGP before they had been adopted by national authorities. In other words, the euro area is responding to the crisis by creating a new and more comprehensive model of economic governance. This is aimed at preventing imbalances in all policy areas before they can trigger crises – and managing crises more effectively when they do arise. In many ways, this response is sui generis and departs from the template we associate with political federations. For example, the “two pack” gives the Commission the power to demand the kind of reforms that the U.S. federal government could not demand of a U.S. state. Moreover, the federal government would not be able to sanction a state if, for example, its tax code was leading to a local housing bubble. This is now not excluded in the euro area under the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure.  This new model is under development and still needs to be perfected – in particular in the financial sector, more work still needs to be done. That said, problems of regulatory arbitrage created by national level banking supervision are being addressed through an increasing harmonisation of supervisory standards and the establishment of a European System of Financial Supervisors with new European Supervisory Authorities. Europe is also exceeding international benchmarks in transposing the new Basel III rules. We may be seeing the beginning of a euro area framework for banking sector recapitalisation and resolution with the decision to allow the ESM to recapitalise banks in non-programme countries. Indeed, a modest first step that will be followed by others in the future.  Conclusion To conclude, the euro area has learned that the original design of EMU was incomplete, and is now working hard to complete it. For various reasons, the euro area is not in a position to adopt in the near term the institutions of a political federation. This means that it has to take a different road to increase overall stability and – in true European tradition – a sui generis approach is being developed that focuses on preventing imbalances and improving collective management of crisis. It is clear that this approach implies a loss of sovereignty. The crisis has proved that the euro area is a political entity which is not self-adjusting; it needs to be actively governed, and this cannot happen without Member States sharing more powers with each other. In other words, there has been a belated recognition that monetary union entails political union. This shift has profound implications for the involvement of all levels of governments in the European project: EU institutions, national governments, national parliaments, and even local governments are all required to participate in the common governance of the euro area. Managing this process represents the next great challenge of European integration.       [1]Under the MIP, an interest-bearing deposit can be imposed after one failure to comply with the recommended corrective action. After a second compliance failure, this interest-bearing deposit can be converted into a fine (up to 0.1% of GDP). Sanctions can also be imposed for failing twice to submit a sufficient corrective action plan.",1
"8","“What role for finance?”   University lecture by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, at the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Lisbon, 6 May 2010 Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to thank Universidade Nova very warmly for the kind invitation and the opportunity to deliver a lecture here. I have chosen the title “What role for finance?” because the past three years have taught us how important it is to reflect on this question. And I have chosen it for a university lecture because I believe that university researchers – and the young people they educate – will make a vital contribution to re-thinking the role of finance in our societies.  Finance touches virtually every sphere of human endeavour – from individuals and households to corporations and governments. But the crisis has posed a provocative question to which many people would like an answer: why and to what extent does society need finance?  In recent economic history, the answer has always been dependent on circumstances. In times of affluence, when finance makes lenders and borrowers alike rich and respected, the answer is resoundingly positive. In contrast, in times of economic regress, disillusionment with markets suggests to an embittered public that financiers of all kinds are the same as short-term speculators motivated by greed.  I will try to bring a timeless perspective to these vacillating public attitudes towards finance. To anticipate my line of reasoning, I think that – at a minimum – the crisis has belied the long-standing conviction in macroeconomics, that “ where enterprise leads, finance follows”.  Contrary to Joan Robinson’s 1952 dictum, I think that financial structures are part of the deep texture of an economy. They are relevant for trend growth and for shaping the business cycle around the trend. Here, I side more with Joseph Schumpeter, who in 1934 wrote: “He (the banker) stands between those who wish to form new combinations and the possessors of productive means… He is the ephor (the overseer) of the exchange economy”.  At the same time, and again in contrast to Joan Robinson’s view of “finance as a veil”, I see financial structures as a prime source of aggregate uncertainty. The economic relevance of shocks that originate in the markets for lending and borrowing is incalculable. It cannot be measured in normal times. It is difficult to quantify even in times of crisis. But we all know that it is large, and that no society can afford to let finance sever its ties to the real economy.  Yet, over the past two decades, financial players have gradually expanded their activities beyond Schumpeter’s idea of intermediation between savers and investors. The financial sector has gradually and quietly decoupled – at least in part – from the real economy. Financial innovations and the trading book are increasingly seen as a more profitable business line than extending loans to businesses. Credit default swaps, asset-backed securities and collateralised debt obligations are the most illustrative examples of this change of focus.  In my remarks today I will discuss this quiet shift in the paradigm of finance. I will explore how finance creates economic value, and why – at times – it can do more harm than good. I will conclude by proposing a way forward – a way that discourages business models oriented to the short term, that promotes healthy financial innovation and that ensures long-term financial stability.   I. Finance, economic growth and welfare Let me start with my provocative question: why and to what extent does society need finance?  Beyond the sanctification of finance in booms and the banker-bashing in crises – society does need finance. Society needs finance for five key reasons that give economic value to financial intermediation: [1]    First, external finance reduces the need for self-finance. Self-finance constrains investment.    Second, finance provides screening and monitoring services that help society to evaluate and rank investment projects.   Third, finance facilitates the management and diversification of risk. Otherwise, entrepreneurs would find many sources of risk unbearable.   Fourth, finance promotes the transformation of liquidity. Savers place high value on liquidity while investors need the opportunity to invest long-term.   And fifth, finance facilitates the process of price discovery.    The first function, the provision of external funds, is most apparent in the economics of industrial revolutions. What drove the industrial revolution in England in the 18th century?  True, in those days the initial outlays for setting up a business were relatively modest: production facilities were small and machinery was cheap. So retained earnings from craftsmanship, family equity or loans from relatives or friends were the dominant form of finance. [2]  But the true inflection point in the economic fortunes of nations – the point at which the pattern of growth turned definitively upwards – did not come until heavy capital investments could lengthen the life of the production cycle. A steady rise in the wealth of nations required a large injection of capital. [3]  Without access to credit, such large upfront payments of production resources simply would not have been possible. Without credit, production processes are constrained to an economically inefficient scale. [4] The opportunity to borrow against future income streams reduced the constraints on the ability of entrepreneurs to invest in bigger machines and larger premises.  Today, access to external funding is no less important. It has the potential to spur economic innovation and allows production facilities to be operated efficiently through standing credit lines.  Access to credit is not only important for businesses. Students can receive a loan in expectation of the higher income that they are likely to earn later in their lives. Student loans permit the enjoyment of the benefits of a higher education at a time in life when income is low.  Credit makes promising projects possible – whether they are embodied in physical capital or in better education.  The provision of screening and monitoring services is the second key function of finance. Specialised screening of the quality of borrowers is an effective remedy against the problem of adverse selection in credit markets. Financial intermediaries acquire, process and evaluate information about potential borrowers. In doing so, they help reduce the large costs that we – as individuals – would face if lending of savings were not intermediated.  Likewise, banks are more effective at monitoring the behaviour of borrowers after funds have been allocated. They can thereby reduce the costs associated with moral hazard – a situation in which asymmetric information can lead borrowers to take action that erodes the value of the loan.  Stock markets can also perform this duty. Influential research literature claims that liquid stock markets help foster corporate governance and hence reduce moral hazard. [5] The basic intuition is straightforward. If managerial compensation is directly linked to stock market performance, either through contracts or stock ownership, managers have an incentive to select and implement actions that increase shareholder wealth.  The transformation and management of risk – the third key function of financial institutions in modern societies – became the focus of attention during the recent financial crisis. I will turn to the dark side of this function later. For now, let me stress the potential value of risk management. Financial markets provide savers with a large array of instruments that allow them to diversify the risks associated with their investments along two broad dimensions: across firms, industries and nations; and over time. [6] Financial markets also allow entrepreneurs to manage risks from sources such as movements of interest rates or currencies. Financial institutions are able to hedge another type of risk – liquidity risk. Liquidity transformation – the fourth function in my list – helps control liquidity risk for the aggregate economy. Individuals generally express a high preference for liquidity in anticipation of uncertain future disbursements. So, there is a tendency – on the lenders’ side – for a large share of savings to be held in cash, or in very short-term debt instruments. Borrowers, however, typically require loans with a long maturity. The more potentially lucrative a project, the more deferred its economic payoffs. We can see here the emergence of a trade-off between the social value of a long-term investment and the private value of liquidity.  Financial intermediaries – in particular depository institutions – reconcile the trade-off. By engaging in maturity transformation, they make it possible for socially-valued long-term projects to be funded by privately-desirable liquidity. Likewise, well-developed equity markets constitute a permanent source of funding for companies while savers are able quickly and easily to convert their shares back into cash.  The final key function of finance is “ price discovery.” In textbook financial markets, asset prices on average reflect all economically relevant information. The market force that moves the trading system close to this ideal – in which prices are “correct” given the current state of knowledge – is arbitrage, the simultaneous purchase and sale of the same asset in two different markets at advantageously different prices.  By engaging in arbitrage, financial players eliminate price discrimination. By removing price differences that are not motivated by differences in payoffs or underlying risk characteristics, arbitrage eliminates the potential for rents in the economy.  In summary, financial intermediation – if well-designed and properly administered – has the capacity to allocate financial funds more efficiently in the economy. By doing so, it has the power to raise the level of savings and investment.  This is not just theory. A growing body of empirical evidence using very different methodologies and datasets for various countries has established that finance – and by finance I mean both banks and markets – can exert a positive influence on capital accumulation and economic growth. [7] The findings also suggest that there is no institutional structure – the mix between banks and markets – that is optimal for fostering growth.  What matters is that people have access to financial instruments; the exact type and composition is of secondary importance.   II. Financial developments, innovations and excesses Let me now turn to the darker side of finance. Robert Merton – one of the architects of modern financial theory – once said: “Any virtue can readily become a vice if taken to excess, and just so with innovations”. [8] When – and how – can finance turn into a source of instability and economic regress?  My answer is simple. When function 2 is ignored, and functions 3, 4 and 5 are abused. In other words, when screening and monitoring services are neglected, and when risk management, liquidity transformation and price discovery are flawed.  There is unlikely to be a better case study of the functional degradation of finance than the events that led up to the crisis that started in 2007. I am convinced that if banks neglect their primary activity of due diligence, and if they come to abuse risk control techniques, liquidity creation and arbitrage opportunities, finance will do more harm than good to the economy. And crises of the magnitude that we have witnessed become unavoidable.  This is not to say that financial markets are solely to blame for the financial crisis. Policy-makers, regulators and supervisors also bear some responsibility for the incidents that led to the most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression. But understanding the impact of the paradigm shift of private finance in recent years demands a deep introspection into the inner mechanisms of financial economics.   1. The neglect of screening and monitoring activities Let me recall the essence of the screening duty of banks. Banks acquire and evaluate information about potential borrowers. At the heart of this duty is a thorough due diligence at the start of the contract and continual monitoring of the creditworthiness of the borrower and the quality of investment, as the project progresses. A precondition for due diligence and monitoring is that the creditor-borrower relationship is continued.  Securitisation of loans made loan discontinuation possible. The bank would extend a loan but immediately pool it together with loans of similar scope and characteristics, so that the idiosyncratic risk inherent in each individual contract would find compensation in the idiosyncratic risk of other contracts. The law of large numbers would take care of cross-loan return compensation within the pool. So, the return to the pool would be less risky and more predictable than the return to any of its constituent components. In fact, the pool would turn a heterogeneous collection of assets into a standardised financial object that could be placed in the market.  The traditional banking model, in which banks would issue loans and hold them until they are repaid, was replaced by “ originate and distribute”. In this new model, banks would not hold the loans they originated. They would pass the loans onto other financial investors by slicing and repackaging the claims attached to them. In other words, by securitising the loans.  The prevalence of this model led to significant growth in the market for structured finance in the United States and, to a lesser extent, in Europe. For instance, the volume of residential mortgage-backed securities issued in the United States was around EUR 200 billion in 2006. [9] Ten years before, this kind of security hardly existed.  Sub-prime lending, which was the outgrowth of securitisation, is not bad per se. It extends credit to people who, for various reasons would otherwise be denied credit. But by definition, sub-prime loans are inherently riskier for lenders as the probability of delinquency is inversely related to the creditworthiness of the borrower. But delinquency risk is less of a concern if there is an expectation that the loan can be readily sold off and somebody else will have to face the consequence of non-performance.  This expectation was a powerful trigger of sub-prime loan growth. Sub-prime mortgage lending in the United States grew from USD 33 billion in 1993 to around USD 700 billion in 2006, the year preceding the beginning of the crisis [10], when nearly one in four US mortgages was sub-prime. At the same time, these borrowers were responsible for around 50% of all US foreclosures. These numbers provide a good idea about the quantum of risk that was inherent in the balance sheets of the US financial system. Fatally, securitisation had lessened lenders’ incentives for prudent screening and steady monitoring. A recent study finds that the opportunity to securitise sub-prime mortgages reduces the incentives for financial intermediaries to carefully screen and monitor borrowers. [11] The intuition is straightforward. If banks are allowed to put the large risk that a sub-prime mortgage loan poses off-balance sheet by securitising it, they will concentrate their business efforts in expanding the originations. This seems consistent with the facts. After all, the share of securitised sub-prime mortgages in the US reached 75% in 2006, up from 54% in 2001. [12] Hence, only a small share of sub-prime mortgages remained on the balance sheet of the originating institution.   2. The abuse of risk management duties Conducting a fully-fledged risk analysis requires full information. The ultimate investors in securitised loans could in principle have exercised the due diligence that banks were no longer providing. But risk management was difficult, paradoxically, because information became unavailable to investors. It was buried in financial structures that were not transparent. Paradoxically, securitisation – a new technique to control risk – had made risk control practically impossible.  The “originate and distribute” business strategy had turned risk into a commodity. Risk could be bundled, sliced and re-bundled for further sale. Securitisation and financial derivatives were the vehicles through which risk became marketable, passed between participants, spread across the system and – in this way – it became difficult to localise and quantify.  Individually, diversified strategies all looked like rational attempts to unload risk to those parties in the system that were more willing and able to bear it. In the aggregate, however, strategies all looked alike!  Viewed across the system, diversification was subject to a fallacy of composition. Individual strategies were diversified. But the aggregation of a complex web of identical strategies – all designed to shed risk individually – generated a lack of diversity for the financial system as a whole. In the end, it turned out that the system could not diversify risk away.   3. Flawed liquidity transformation Through the use of short-term repurchase agreements banks increasingly financed their longer-term asset holdings with shorter maturity market instruments. Off-balance sheet structured investment vehicles (SIVs) became popular as a result of wholesale financing. Rather than relying on deposits from private savers, as was the norm in the traditional banking model, the banking system started to borrow funds off-balance sheet in the money market by selling short-term commercial papers and engaging in repurchase agreements. This shift in funding was a by-product of securitisation as much as a source of its potentially unlimited expansion. This self-referential circuit of finance – where asset acquisition created funding needs and funding mechanisms expanded asset acquisition even further – is evident in the data. The share of total investment bank assets that were financed by overnight repurchase agreements roughly doubled from 2000 to 2007. [13]  While deposits provide a rather stable and dependable source of funding for financing longer-term investments, the market for commercial papers and repurchase agreements can be prone to sudden shifts in confidence. Indeed, in the summer of 2007, with investors pulling back from asset-backed securities, banks saw the value of their assets and hence their capital base declining dramatically.  4. Financial excesses  In the end, the social costs of negligence and abuse were devastating. Even more so, because finance had expanded at an unsustainable pace in the years leading up to the 2007/2008 crisis. A number of economies had come to pin their national fortunes on a sector that is potentially very profitable, but also ruinously risky. The financial industry has grown substantially during the past three decades. In 1977 the share of financial intermediation in total US gross value added was around 5%. In 2007 this share was over 8%. It was also a highly profitable business for years. Financial sector compensation as a share of total US compensation doubled during the last thirty years. In the euro area this share rose by roughly 25%.  High earnings attracted many bright young people into the industry. Although the total number of employees in the financial sector remained relatively stable, higher than average wages in the finance industry led to a diversion of highly-skilled individuals from the real economy to the financial sector. [14] For instance, in 2006 a financial industry employee earned 35% more than an engineer with a similar level of education.  These numbers speak a clear language. Financial creativity had its price. Banks increased their demand for highly-skilled talents, bidding up the market clearing wage in this industry. Whether or not financial employees have been overcompensated is a difficult question. But they have certainly been given the wrong incentives.  A less difficult question is whether talent was always and everywhere employed in a productive way. Here my answer is no. Many financial instruments were not invented to finance the ownership of additional homes, to finance productive investments or education or to help firms hedge the uncertainties of currency or interest rate risk. Some of these instruments were invented to generate fees without creating social value.   The way forward Looking ahead, what can be done to ensure that financial institutions return to the path of virtue? The extent of the financial crisis leaves no doubt that tighter regulations and supervision are required to overhaul the financial system. But a fine line needs to be drawn between ensuring financial efficiency – and financial innovation is an important ingredient of efficiency – and financial stability. Excessive, ill-designed regulation may counteract our intentions.  To improve the resilience of the financial system we need first to identify the sources of instability and fragility. Not all financial institutions have been equally involved in developments that led to the 2007/2008 financial crisis. It seems that the current predicament originated mainly in institutions that had moved away from traditional retail banking, from institutions that increasingly relied on non-interest income and non-deposit-funding. [15]  These insights should serve as a starting point for shaping the contours of the post-crisis financial system. Reforms should be designed in a way that ensures that those segments of finance, which remain faithful to the mission of providing functional services to the real economy, are not put at an economic disadvantage. Profit maximisation sets the incentives in a market economy to achieve first-best outcomes. But just as employers bear a social responsibility for their employees, banks bear a social responsibility for savers and for society as a whole. Reforms must be targeted at internalising this social responsibility in business strategies so that what is collectively optimal is selected by profit-maximising business units.  I see three elements at the core of efforts to reform the international financial system:   The first ingredient is a mechanism that enforces transparency in financial structures. This is essential for the financial industry to return to its prime mission of assessing the quality of investment. The trend towards more sophisticated financial instruments has not been matched by increasing disclosure requirements. Sellers of securitised products must disclose all information about the underlying loan structure so that both investors and rating agencies can correctly price the risks embedded in these products. More transparency can also be achieved by central counterparty clearing of bilateral over-the-counter trading arrangements.    Second, the progressive mutation of arbitrage into speculation needs to be reversed. Financial players that take large speculative positions in certain segments of the market can exert a non-negligible bearing on the future pricing of an asset or bond by affecting market sentiment. Current market structures can aggravate this effect. For instance, investors are currently allowed to buy credit defaults swaps without holding the underlying asset, typically a bond. By first buying the credit default swaps and then trying to affect market sentiment by going short on the underlying bond, investors can make large profits without a change in the fundamental value of the reference entity and, worse, to its detriment.   Third, credit and liquidity risk management should not become a force of pro-cyclicality for the financial system as a whole. Limited liability in economic contracts introduces an asymmetry that is potentially fatal in the financial sphere. Owners and managers of financial companies are given a distinct incentive to expand risk-taking in anticipation of high returns (if there is a favourable pay-off), while remaining confident of a limited loss in the event of failure. The perception that public authorities will always socialise the costs of financial crisis reinforces private investors’ expectation that they will harvest more of the upside and shift more of the downside. Regulation should attempt to limit the risks banks assume by imposing higher, countercyclical capital requirements, thus limiting leverage. Financial institutions will be asked to raise the quality and quantity of their capital base to ensure they have adequate funding in place as a buffer against future market disruptions. A correction of compensation practices for financial employees is also warranted. Compensation should put emphasis on rewarding longer-term business performance. These objectives are currently examined within the framework of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.    Implementing these measures will lead the return to a more sustainable, longer-term business model for banks. At the global level, the G20 and the Financial Stability Board have become the main forum for international cooperation on these reforms. Complemented by macroprudential supervision that takes due account of the interconnectedness of financial institutions and systemic risk, these reforms will pave the way for lower market volatility and hence greater financial stability.  A courageous overhaul of the financial system will also help to bridge the rising gap that has emerged between the financial sector and the real economy. We cannot afford financial activities that neglect the interest of the real economy. Indeed, the financial industry and the real economy must share a common goal. Only united will they contribute to strong, sustainable and balanced growth and to future economic prosperity.  Thank you for your attention.   References Allen, F. and D.

"9","(Under-)pricing of risks in the financial sector   Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBdelivered at the Coface Country Risk Conference 2009 Carrousel du Louvre, Paris, 19 January 2009      I. Introduction    Ladies and Gentlemen, The current juncture presents us with a particularly important moment to conduct a deep analysis of the pricing of risk – and the mis-pricing of risk – in the financial sector. It is no exaggeration to say that, for several decades, there has been no more relevant moment for this topic than today.  In my view, the appropriate identification, assessment and handling of risks in the financial sector are the key issue to be considered most carefully amid the current global financial turmoil. Looking back, the main factor that I would identify as underlying the turmoil is the broad-based under-appreciation of risk. This under-appreciation of risk has been observed across financial institutions, across markets and across economies. Looking ahead, the main lesson I believe we need to draw is therefore for the financial sector to establish a much more rigorous identification, assessment and handling of risk.  Against this background, I am very pleased to participate in this major conference on risk analysis today. It brings together specialists from France and abroad from the banking and corporate sectors as well as from academia. In my remarks, I would like to share with you some thoughts on three areas: the fundamental causes of the financial turmoil, the main avenues for financial sector reform and some of the broader lessons to conclude from the current episode.       II. Under-pricing of risk    Let me begin with the causes of the turmoil: in the four years to August 2007, macro-financial conditions were very favourable on the surface. Economic growth was exceptionally strong and stable, liquidity in capital markets was abundant and the financial sector was providing remarkable returns: profitability was high, many asset prices were rising, implied volatilities in equity markets, bond markets, credit markets and foreign exchange markets were all very low by historical standards, and finally: risk premia were extraordinarily small. At the same time, the world economy was growing vigorously, in an overall low inflation environment and stable macroeconomic environment as a whole. The only warning sign, which was brushed aside by many economists, consisted of the significant build-up of imbalances at various levels in the global economy and the global financial system.  Against this apparently favourable economic background, innovation was rapidly taking place in financial markets. This was perceived by most observers as a positive development, on balance, because it enabled a better and wider distribution of risk. In fact, the diversification of risk appeared to be beneficial not just for the financial sector’s stability, but also for the real economy, since companies were able to more efficiently spread the risks they were bearing. This perception is likely to have encouraged risk-taking not only inside but also outside the financial sector. However, as the turmoil has since shown, there was a generalised tendency to overestimate the true degree of risk spreading and diversification, especially in credit markets.  Warnings by the authorities about the possibility of an abrupt correction in financial markets date back to 2006. Many warnings were made about the risks associated with what was essentially a “pricing for perfection” – which, put simply, meant that risk premia were not, or hardly pricing in the possibility of anything going wrong. Given such pricing, even a small change in conditions had the capacity to severely disrupt financial markets. At the same time, a number of financial stability reports – including from the ECB, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) and other organisations – analysed vulnerabilities of the financial sector and warned of emerging weaknesses. [1] In particular, these reports often emphasised that the rapid pace of innovation in financial markets and products coupled with the low level of risk premia called for investors to take greater care in understanding and managing the risks they were exposed to. However, while it was perceived that a storm was brewing, it was not known exactly what would trigger it, but that it would be appropriate that the financial sector agents should prepare for it so that the correction would be as orderly as possible. Both the underpricing of the “unit of risk” and, even more importantly in my view, the underestimation of the “quantity of risk” turned out to be at the core of the crisis. Let me explain further how I see these two concepts.      Underpricing of the unit of risk    The underpricing of the unit of risk related mainly to inadequate assumptions made about the distribution of returns to highly complex, new financial securities. Let me mention a few examples. First, take the fact that, in calculating the probability of default of mortgages in a large economy, the possibility of a drop in real estate prices or the ongoing deterioration in lending standards, were not properly factored in, or even totally disregarded. A second example relates to the reliance on recent data to estimate parameters of probability distributions. Statistical models, generally using data based on the recent past, tended to produce over-optimistic estimates due to the apparently very favourable operating environment that preceded the eruption of the turmoil that I just described. The generalised “hunt-for-yield” in global financial markets was also likely to have contributed a great deal to the distortion of the price of the unit of risk. The compression of spreads and risk premia coupled with the search for higher returns tended to lead to a higher level of investors’ appetite for risk. This, in turn, further inflated valuations based on very favourable expectations of future returns. Contributing to the underpricing of a unit of risk was also the opacity and complexity of structured financial products. Not even sophisticated investors were able to assess the risks embedded in these products properly.       Underestimation of the quantity of risk    But in my view, an even more astounding aspect was the generalised under-appreciation of the quantity of risk borne by market participants. In fact, as the turmoil unfolded, some large financial institutions revealed a massive concentration of risk, suggesting that risk management systems had failed to identify the quantity of risk that financial institutions were accumulating. A good example relates to the credit default swap (CDS) market. This market hardly existed in 2002 and grew at an incredible pace to reach a size of $ 58 billion in notional amounts in 2007. By buying protection on a particular bond, market participants believed themselves to be largely insulated against the risk of default of the issuer. However, this protection turned out to be defective when the first signs of financial market distress emerged. In fact, during its steady growth in the pre-turmoil phase, the performance of the CDS market under stress had not been tested before. This market also brought home the importance of counterparty risk – a crucial notion in risk assessment – which, it seems, was not always fully understood and accounted for in market participants’ management of risks before the turmoil erupted. Another example refers to the failure of the same risk management systems to assess the systemic consequences arising from the turmoil. Take, for example, the risks involved in relying excessively on short-term debt to finance long-term assets, both by financial intermediaries and the corporate sector. These risks were barely accounted for. In fact, the probability of a sudden closure of specific markets was assumed to be very close to, if not, zero. To put it in more general terms, cross-correlations across and between defaults on the one hand and the rest of the economy on the other hand were generally not properly factored in when calculating probabilities of default. The limited importance given to risks of a systemic nature was thus responsible, to a large extent, for the massive underestimation of the quantity of risks borne by market players, as shown by the unfolding of the crisis.  In general, the evaluation methodology of the quantity of risk and the price of a unit of risk has turned out highly inadequate in the light of the current experience. The dominant models rely on simplified hypotheses, consisting of laws of probabilities about future events. The periods of crisis bring to light the major shortcomings of the underlying mathematical models. In these periods the behaviour of markets and prices does not appear to follow any probabilistic model ex ante but rather reflects a more fundamental Knightian uncertainty in which even probabilities are unknown.        III. Three main factors to be addressed    After reflecting on the origins of the crisis and the initial lessons learnt over the past 18 months since the turmoil erupted, let me now turn to the future and the avenues for reform to be addressed in our response to the crisis. I would like to highlight three areas where, in my view, change is particularly needed. First, there is the need to address short-termism, i.e. the excessive focus on short-term returns in the financial sector, part of what is often called the “bank-bonus culture”. Short-termism may encourage excessive risk-taking, since less attention is paid to low-probability outcomes which might only crystallise over longer periods of time. More worrying is the fact that it can exacerbate the impact of conflicts of interest and perverse incentives at all levels within a financial institution. Considerable thought is being devoted to compensation-related issues both by the official sector (e.g. the Financial Stability Forum) and market participants themselves. Sound and reasonable principles for compensation schemes at large financial institutions, including incentives for prudent long-term behaviour, and a real adjustment to risk are some important ways for reform. A second factor to be addressed in our response to the crisis relates to the enhancement of transparency in financial markets. As the turmoil has shown, the availability of aggregate information regarding the main risks to the financial system is of the essence. Information on institutions, instruments and markets that are currently unregulated, but whose risks raise financial stability concerns on account of their potential systemic impact, proved to be crucial for effective financial stability monitoring and accurate risk assessment. One clear example of some first steps taken in the right direction relate to the initiative to establish a central counterparty clearing house for the CDS market, a move that I strongly welcome. This would be a first important contribution to increasing transparency in over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets. Increasing the number of standardised securities exchanged on regulated markets would also make it easier to price these financial instruments, based on relevant public information and on traded prices. Finally, a third factor that, in my view, needs to be addressed is the excessive pro-cyclicality of the financial system in its entirety, i.e., the tendency of the financial system to accumulate too much risk and leverage in good times, and to shed risks hastily in a downturn. We should endeavour to systematically eliminate wherever possible the elements that reinforce or amplify the spontaneous cyclicality of the financial economy. In particular, but not exclusively, we have to reassess from this point of view capital requirements, valuation and leverage, provisioning regimes as well as banks’ compensation schemes. In this field, I also welcome the work being carried out under the auspices of the Financial Stability Forum.      IV. First lessons drawn from the current situation    We are going through an exceptional period marked by a recent intensification of the financial turmoil since last September and by a major slowdown in the global economy. Virtually all economies – both industrialised as well as emerging – have been moving in the same direction since the end of 2008, which has contributed to the magnitude of the overall current downswing.  In conclusion, I would like to draw your attention to three points, which I consider as important: First of all, the full-scale test to which the global financial system is subject reveals an excessive fragility that the prevailing mathematical models had not anticipated. This fragility is unacceptable. The global market economy, in all its elements, including and especially in its financial component, must considerably strengthen its resistance to shocks, i.e. its resilience. This calls for a set of ambitious reforms aiming to introduce, re-introduce and reinforce if need be counter-cyclical mechanisms and the shock-absorbers in the financial system. Financial and economic fluctuations are inevitable and necessary in a market economy. It is up to us to ensute that we don’t amplify those shocks by our own making and our own rules, as is the case at the moment. Shocks, sometimes abrupt, are inevitable: they may come from technology and innovation, from structural transformations that characterise globalisation, from geostrategic risks and many other angles. It is up to us to deal with them as smoothly as possible, not only at the level of the economies concerned but also at global level. The corresponding reforms must be systematic without giving the least privilege to any entity and without focusing attention either on a few scapegoats. As a matter of fact, everything can and must be substantially improved. In second place, we should note the rapid reaction of the public authorities, central banks and governments in particular, in these exceptional circumstances. Of course, I am not referring to the decisions taken since the start of the turbulence on 9 August 2007: you may remember that the ECB’s Executive Board decided to lend overnight at our refinancing rate €95 billion to the commercial banks in the euro area. What I want to talk about are the decisions of the European Central Bank and the other central banks after the crisis worsened in September concerning the organisation of what I would call a line of defence against a systemic threat of illiquidity: those decisions have led us to expand the collateral framework and to commit to ourselves to refinancing without limit a fixed interest rate, at one week, one month, three months and six months. The governments themselves have set up a second line of defence against the systemic solvency threat. They have done so by organising, whenever necessary, support to ailing institutions and by systematically supporting the banking sector by means of guarantees and recapitalisation. The difficulties are still there, and in these circumstances there is no room for whatever form of complacency. We have to remain permanently ready to act.  My third point concerns confidence. Confidence is the most precious ingredient today. It is also the ingredient that is lacking most in the real and financial sphere of the economy at present. Having underestimated considerably the true underlying risks that were lying ahead in 2008 and 2009, it would be an error of equal magnitude for the actors of the private sector to now overestimate the risks that are lying ahead over the medium term, for 2010 and beyond. The year 2009 will be very difficult, as I mentioned last Thursday. The ECB’s Governing Council considers that economic growth in the global economy and in Europe will be substantially lower than projected in early December. However, I see at least four reasons to have confidence in a recovery of the global economy and the industrialised economies over the medium term, after the trying year of 2009:     The responsiveness of public authorities, central banks and governments, in a difficult situation makes out of the current episode a unique period in economic and financial history. I do not consider that the scope of the actions by public authorities has been sufficiently taken into account by the private actors.    The growth potential of the large and emerging economies is considerable: the deceleration of their growth patterns currently observed will be temporary; for several of them the potential growth of domestic demand, which today is suppressed, is enormous.    Technological progress is remarkable and even accelerating in the current period: it will be the source of an important part of tomorrow’s economic growth.    An important factor in the current slowdown has been the spike in oil and commodity prices. This spike was both inflationary and contractionary. The current sharp decline is, by consequence, both dis-inflationary and expansionary.     For all these reasons, which are not exhaustive, after an exceptionally difficult 2009, it seems to be a good working hypothesis to me to see 2010 as the year of rebound. The European Central Bank and the Eurosystem will for their part continue to provide a solid anchor of stability and confidence over the medium and long term, in the service of our 329 million citizens.       [1] See, ECB Financial Stability Review issues of 2006 and 2007, for example and the speech given by J.-C. Trichet in Davos in January 2007 (see Financial Times, 29 January 2007 article entitled “ Prepare for Asset Repricing, Warns Trichet ” Excerpts: “Current conditions in global financial markets look potentially unstable, suggesting that investors need to prepare themselves for a significant repricing of some assets, Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, warned at the weekend in Davos. The recent explosion of structured financial products and derivatives had made it more difficult for regulators and investors to judge the current risks in the financial system, Mr Trichet said. We are currently seeing elements in global financial markets which are not necessarily stable, he said, pointing to the low level of rates, spreads and risk premiums as factors that could trigger a repricing.”)",1
"10","\""Challenges ahead\"": The accession process   Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London, 12 November 2001. Ladies and gentlemen,  It is a great pleasure for me to be able to be here today at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to share with you some thoughts on the process of EU accession and the challenges that this process poses for the accession countries. While recognising that this process raises challenges for the EU itself, I will not elaborate on those in my speech today.  Undoubtedly, the enlargement of the European Union to embrace a number of countries from central, eastern and southern Europe and the Mediterranean constitutes, after the changeover to the euro banknotes and coins, one of the main challenges currently faced by European policy-makers. However, I would be giving a somewhat misleading impression if I devoted my speech today solely to the \""challenges ahead\"" without first mentioning the very foundations of the European structure. The latter form the basis for our capacity to actually meet those challenges.  EU enlargement rests on the proven success of European integration. The European Union constitutes an unprecedented framework for the successful development of regional co-operation. Not only have the original objectives of European integration been achieved, namely to ensure peace and prosperity in a historically conflict-ridden part of the world, the European Union has also shown its ability to overcome the various economic and political challenges with which it has been confronted throughout its almost 45-year history. Such is the attractiveness of the European integration project that, since the Treaty of Rome was signed in 1957, nine countries have joined the original six, and a host of others are keen to do so. A key accomplishment of this progress towards \""ever closer union\"" will become truly tangible in a few weeks' time, on 1 January 2002, when most of the citizens of the European Union will finally have the euro, our money, in their pockets.  In many ways, the prospect of EU accession has also been instrumental in triggering reform in the 12 countries currently negotiating entry into the EU, namely five Central and Eastern European countries, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia; three Baltic States, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania; two southern European countries, Bulgaria and Romania; and Cyprus and Malta in the Mediterranean. Following some troublesome years at the beginning of the transition process, the accession countries have made substantial progress in building institutions and designing appropriate policy. The accession countries have now generally achieved macroeconomic stability. The significance of these achievements can be demonstrated by the resilience shown by the accession countries to the Asian and Russian crises in 1997-1998 and, more recently, to the adverse developments in Argentina and other emerging market economies.  However, a number of important challenges remain. The years to come will be crucial to ensure that the current significant momentum of the accession process is maintained, and that the remaining difficulties are dealt with effectively in order to permit the smooth integration of accession countries into the EU and, later on, into the euro area.  The forthcoming enlargement of the EU will, no doubt, increase the diversity and complexity within the Union in an unprecedented way. In economic terms, the discrepancies in real per capita income and price levels between the accession countries and the euro area are of a magnitude that has never been observed in previous enlargement rounds. In this regard, however, it should be borne in mind that the combined GDP of all the accession countries accounts for only around 5% of that of the EU. The enlargement also confronts European policy-makers with enormous challenges in political and institutional terms. The sheer increase in the number of Member States that the current enlargement represents renders the functioning of decision-making bodies more difficult. As we all know, substantial institutional reforms are needed to ensure that the EU can continue to function effectively after enlargement.  From the Eurosystem's perspective, there are five economic issues that appear to be of greater relevance at the current juncture: real convergence, inflation developments in the accession countries, monetary policy and exchange rate strategies, capital account liberalisation, and the structure and functioning of the financial sector. Let me elaborate briefly on each of these.       1. Real convergence    Sustainable rates of GDP growth will be a key challenge for accession countries in the years, and even decades, to come. 2000 was the first year since the beginning of the transition process in which all accession countries experienced positive growth. The degree of real convergence with the euro area, that is, the catching-up of the per capita income and price levels of accession countries with those of the euro area, has remained limited. Looking ahead, it appears unlikely that the overall growth differential between the accession countries and the euro area will be significantly higher than a few percentage points. Overall, the gap between the average GDP per capita of the accession countries and that of the euro area remains large. On average, GDP per capita in the accession countries is, in terms of purchasing power parity, around 44% of that of the euro area, and this figure is even lower when current exchange rates are taken into account. The size of the gap, combined with the limited growth differentials, suggests that the process of real convergence will be a very slow one, likely to continue far beyond the tentative dates for EU accession and for the adoption of the euro.  Hence, although differences in income levels are compatible with membership of EMU, it is important for accession countries to progress in the process of real convergence with the euro area. In particular, real convergence can help to create economic cohesion within EMU and promote integration between Members States. Further real convergence will also help to minimise the risks and the effects of asymmetric shocks. Against this background, it seems crucial that accession countries pursue structural policies that enhance the potential output growth of their economies.       2. Inflation developments    With regard to inflation developments, I should like to stress that, on the whole, the accession countries have made remarkable progress in bringing inflation down to single-digit rates. Inflation in the accession countries is expected to average around 6%-7% by the end of this year. However, reducing inflation from relatively low levels to even lower ones is clearly a difficult task. Evidence points to a number of micro and macroeconomic factors which affect current inflation rates in the accession countries. These include ongoing price liberalisation, privatisation processes, relatively expansionary fiscal policies and stubborn inflation expectations. Inflationary pressures stemming from high productivity growth in the tradable sector of fast-growing economies – known as the Balassa-Samuelson effect – have also been cited as one of the main reasons for higher inflation in catching-up economies, such as those of the accession countries.  A closer examination of inflation developments in the accession countries shows, however, that the Balassa-Samuelson effect alone cannot explain the persistence of inflation differentials vis-à-vis the euro area. Moreover, notwithstanding its importance, the Balassa-Samuelson effect should not be overstated when explaining current inflation rates in the accession countries. Indeed, most empirical studies estimate the Balassa-Samuelson effect within a range of 1 to 2 percentage points. This does not mean, however, that the pursuit of real convergence conflicts with further progress on disinflation. On the contrary, the process of disinflation should be advanced in the accession countries, at a pace determined by the overall economic situation and in particular by the need for these countries to increase real convergence. The Maastricht inflation criterion, which will not be revised to take into account any possible Balassa-Samuelson effect, should not be seen as an immediate requirement for these countries, but rather as a medium-term objective for central banks. As the experience of some euro area participants shows, progress in nominal and real convergence can be, and should be, pursued in parallel. Indeed, the experience of countries such as Greece, Spain and Portugal confirms that a key element of their successful entry into the euro area was their success in controlling sources of inflation other than the Balassa-Samuelson effect. In particular, a balanced monetary and fiscal policy mix and the control of real wage increases have supported the disinflation process in these countries, and allowed them to advance in the process of nominal convergence without compromising the gradual catching-up in real incomes.       3. Monetary policy and exchange rate strategies    With regard to monetary policy and exchange rate strategies, most accession countries have already indicated their intention to join ERM II as early as possible after entry into the EU. The accession countries have also signalled their intention to adopt the euro as soon as possible, that is, after two years of ERM II membership.  The whole issue of the timing of ERM II membership, both as to when to join and how long to remain in the system, is dependent on a somewhat more complex question, namely whether the discipline which ERM II imposes on its members is advantageous for the accession countries. The answer, in our view, is \""yes\"".  Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to reflect on this question for a moment and explain why we hold this view.  Being small open economies, most accession countries cannot disregard exchange rate developments when making their monetary policy decisions. The exchange rate is generally a more potent transmission channel of monetary policy decisions than domestic interest rates, and it also plays a crucial role in explaining the pass-through to price developments in most accession countries. Thus, in order to achieve further disinflation and sustainable growth, excessive exchange rate fluctuations need to be avoided. In our view, and this view is supported by our previous experiences with the EMS/ERM framework, ERM II provides a useful mechanism to anchor exchange rate expectations. At the same time, ERM II, with its adjustable central rate and its current fluctuation band of ±15%, provides accession countries with the same degree of flexibility as the EMS/ERM following the decision to widen the fluctuation band in 1993. This may be suitable for accession countries. Given that accession countries still need to complete the process of restructuring their economies and catching up in terms of real income, the flexibility inherent in ERM II and its wider fluctuation bands provides accession countries with sufficient scope to accommodate these reforms. Bearing in mind that ERM II constitutes a multilateral arrangement, and that it is consistent with the regional integration process in which all accession countries are deeply involved, ERM II is likely to have fewer potential weaknesses than other alternative exchange rate arrangements have shown over recent years. Of course, as for any exchange rate arrangement, coherence between macroeconomic policies must be ensured for successful participation in ERM II.  With regard to the length of the period of ERM II membership, in view of the varying degrees of convergence of the accession countries, limiting the duration of ERM II membership to the minimum permissible time to qualify for the adoption of the euro – that is, two years – may not be an optimal choice for all accession countries. Longer membership of ERM II may, in some cases, be helpful since it would allow accession countries to retain the exchange rate as an instrumental policy variable during the catching-up process. Indeed, this option has proven useful for most of the current euro area participants. Again, it is worthwhile to recall the examples of Greece, Portugal and Spain. In the case of Greece, the final revaluation of the drachma on 17 January 2000 took place at the request of Greece, with the agreement of the EU authorities, to support the country's efforts to preserve sustainable price stability and progress in real convergence without jeopardising the competitiveness of the economy. Portugal and Spain, which participated in the EMS/ERM for a longer period of time, also used the option of realigning the respective exchange rates of the escudo and the peseta at several points along the road towards entry into the euro area.  Participation in ERM II should, therefore, not be seen as a mere \""waiting room\"" prior to the adoption of the euro. Instead, it should be regarded as a meaningful and flexible framework for increasing nominal and real convergence with the euro area, and for tackling the challenges faced by the accession countries as they progress towards the adoption of the euro. Indeed, the experience of current euro area member countries in the fields of inflation and exchange rate developments strongly suggests that the existing institutional framework for accession to the euro area, including the convergence criteria as defined in the Maastricht Treaty, is sound. Furthermore, this framework should be sufficiently flexible to accommodate most of the challenges that accession countries will face on their path to the eventual adoption of the euro.       4. Capital account liberalisation    Ladies and gentlemen, the fourth economic issue I would like to refer to is capital account liberalisation. In several accession countries, capital movements are still subject to a number of restrictions. The most relevant restrictions, from a monetary policy perspective, apply to short-term portfolio investments. Although transitional periods may be allowed under the Treaty in the early years of EU membership, as well as prior to accession under the Europe Agreements, thus far, only a few countries have requested them. In those few cases, transitional periods mainly relate to areas that are not particularly relevant from a monetary policy point of view (e.g. real estate purchases).  Despite the generally positive impact of capital liberalisation on the growth prospects of the accession countries, one should bear in mind that the speed of capital account liberalisation may carry risks for countries with underdeveloped financial sectors, especially in a context of fixed or tightly managed exchange rate regimes. If not carefully sequenced and supported by consistent macroeconomic and structural policies, capital account liberalisation could pose some risks to macroeconomic or financial stability in the accession countries. It is therefore crucial that the right policies are put into place before EU accession.       5. Financial sector structure and functioning    The last issue I would like to elaborate on concerns the structure and functioning of the financial sector in the accession countries. Partly for historical reasons, the financial sector in the accession countries is largely dominated by the banking sector, whereas other financial sector intermediaries still need to be further developed. Over the past few years, significant progress has been made in restructuring and consolidating the banking sector. This progress has been accomplished through the large-scale privatisation of state-owned banks and through the extensive opening-up of the banking sector to foreign ownership. Undoubtedly, this process has contributed to greater integration with the EU and significant efficiency gains. It has also supported the strengthening of financial stability and provided the banking sector with know-how and capital.  However, the degree of financial intermediation remains rather low and the challenges ahead are considerable. Given the major implications that the structure and functioning of the financial sector may have for macroeconomic developments, a strengthening of the accession countries' financial markets, including the enhancement of legal frameworks and prudential supervision, is needed. The principal reasons for this are twofold. First, the weakness of the financial sector has been partly responsible for the relatively modest growth rates observed in some accession countries during the last decade. In spite of substantial structural reforms in the real sector of the economy, the as yet insufficient development of the financial sectors may have made the transition to a fully functioning market economy more costly in many accession countries. Financial sector development is, therefore, crucial if potential economic growth is to be increased and real incomes are to catch up with those of the euro area. Second, financial stability in the accession countries is of great relevance to the ECB, since it is a central aspect of ensuring the smooth conduct of monetary policy in an enlarged euro area. Financial sector vulnerabilities have to be avoided as they may complicate the efficient working of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. They may also pose great challenges for the conduct of monetary policy, for central banks' credibility and for the maintenance of price stability.  Finally, accession countries have embarked on the process of developing a modern financial market infrastructure. This is essential in order to facilitate the transition from a planned to a market economy and, at the same time, to support the conduct of a single monetary policy in an enlarged euro area. Setting up such a financial infrastructure is, however, a difficult task. First, preparatory work in this field is subject to very long lead times and, therefore, needs to be implemented years before the adoption of the euro. Second, the target of this preparatory work is a moving one: certain components of the euro area financial infrastructure may need to be adapted before new Member States can be integrated into the euro area. Furthermore, there is an ongoing debate in international fora about the optimal structure of modern financial markets in an increasingly integrated global financial system. More and more, market pressures, economies of scale and efficiency gains point to the need for further consolidation of the financial infrastructure. In the context of EU entry, and taking into account the relatively small size of the financial sectors in the accession countries, plans to develop the financial market infrastructure may need to bear in mind the specific conditions applying to accession countries. Indeed, there is a risk that accession countries may now be investing considerable efforts and resources to develop infrastructures similar to those that some euro area countries are trying to rationalise.       Concluding remarks    Ladies and gentlemen, I shall conclude with a few brief remarks of a more general nature. The ultimate goal of entry into the euro area is an ambitious one and, for this reason, it is necessary to start preparing for this prospect well in advance. Broadly speaking, the prospect of EU membership should encourage accession countries to make all the macro and microeconomic adjustments necessary to join the euro area. In this way, EU accession may set in motion a virtuous cycle of long-term sustainable economic growth. As the experience of current euro area participants shows, accession countries may encounter difficulties, and even sometimes feel frustration, during the different stages of this process. However, these difficulties should not discourage accession countries from going ahead with the project of entry into EU and, later on, the euro area.  Undoubtedly, EU enlargement poses great challenges to both the accession countries and to the European Union itself. Creating the right economic and political conditions and adjusting the European institutions for the eventual integration into the EU of all accession countries is certainly an enormous task. However – and here I come back to what I mentioned at the beginning of my speech – the project of European integration should not be regarded just as a stimulating exercise of facing up to never-ending \""challenges ahead\"", but rather as a historic opportunity to deepen and extend the idea of Europe. I am confident that we, as Europeans, and more specifically in our central banking function at the ECB, will be able to master the \""challenges ahead\"" and, in this way, to contribute to the completion of the European project through the successful integration of the future Member States into the euro area.  Thank you for your attention",1
"11","\""Der Euro-Kapitalmarkt: Status Quo und Perspektiven\""   Prof. Otmar Issing, Symposium zum Thema \""Pfandbrief und Kapitalmarkt\"" am 18. Mai 2000 in Frankfurt/Main      Der Beginn der Währungsunion und die Finanzmärkte    Die Geburt des Euro vor nunmehr knapp eineinhalb Jahren war ein historisches, einschneidendes Ereignis. Zum ersten Mal in der Geschichte haben souveräne Staaten ihre Hoheit auf dem Gebiet des Geldwesens an eine neu geschaffene, supranationale Institution übertragen und ihre nationalen Währungen in einem gemeinsamen, einheitlichen Geld aufgehen lassen. Dieser Schritt hat erhebliche Bedeutung für weite Bereiche der Wirtschaft, insbesondere für die Finanzmärkte.  Seit Anfang 1999 ist der Rat der Europäischen Zentralbank für die einheitliche europäische Geldpolitik verantwortlich. Nach dem Vertrag zur Gründung der Europäischen Gemeinschaft ist es das vorrangige Ziel der europäischen Geldpolitik, Preisstabilität im Euro-Währungsgebiet zu gewährleisten. In Erfüllung seines Mandates orientiert der EZB-Rat seine geldpolitischen Entscheidungen ausschließlich an der Preisentwicklung des gesamten Euro-Gebietes.  Die Einführung des Euro und der einheitlichen Geldpolitik hat die Europäische Union auf eine neue Stufe der Integration gehoben. Die einheitliche Währung vollendet nicht nur den Binnenmarkt, mit der Europäischen Zentralbank als supranationaler Institution wird zugleich die ganze Statik des europäischen Hauses verändert. Darüber hinaus eröffnet sich die große Chance, Geldwertstabilität im Euro-Währungsgebiet dauerhaft zu verwirklichen. Geldwertstabilität ist der beste und auf die Dauer der einzige Beitrag der Geldpolitik zu anhaltendem Wirtschafts- und Beschäftigungswachstum. Stabile Preise tragen zu einem besseren Funktionieren des Binnenmarktes bei und schaffen die Grundlage für eine auch international anerkannte Währung.  Einen tiefen Wandel bedeutet die Einführung des Euro für die Finanzmärkte im Allgemeinen und die Kapitalmärkte im Besonderen. Die gemeinsame Währung hat weit reichende Auswirkungen auf Struktur und Entwicklung dieser Märkte.[1]  Die Analyse der Finanzmärkte (einschließlich der an diesen Märkten aktiven Finanzinstitutionen) ist für eine Notenbank von zentraler Bedeutung. Zwischen Geldpolitik und Finanzmärkten gibt es enge Wechselbeziehungen. Die Finanzmärkte stehen einerseits im Zentrum des geldpolitischen Transmissionsprozesses; geldpolitische Entscheidungen wirken über Kreditinstitute und Finanzmärkte auf die Realwirtschaft und die Preisentwicklung. Die EZB hat daher ein überragendes Interesse an einem stabilen Finanzsektor, an gesunden, wettbewerbsfähigen Kreditinstituten und an effizienten Kapitalmärkten. Theoretische Überlegungen und empirische Untersuchungen zeigen, dass die Beibehaltung der Preisstabilität der beste Beitrag einer Zentralbank zur Erhaltung der Stabilität des Finanzsektors ist und dass beide Ziele normalerweise komplementär sind[2]. Eine Notenbank, die glaubwürdig Preisstabilität gewährleistet, vermeidet unerwartete Änderungen von Inflationserwartungen und die damit verbundenen Schwankungen von Wertpapier- und anderen Vermögenspreisen.  Die Preise, die sich auf den Finanzmärkten bilden - Zinsen, Aktienkurse etc. und die entsprechenden Risikoprämien - stellen andererseits wichtige Informationsquellen für die Geldpolitik dar. Erwartungen der Märkte über die künftige Geldpolitik schlagen sich z. B. direkt in der Zinsstruktur nieder. Auf längere Sicht gehen wesentliche Einflüsse von der Geldpolitik auf die Struktur der Finanzmärkte aus.  Die Integration der nationalen Geldmärkte in einen Euro-Geldmarkt ist rasch vorangeschritten und praktisch abgeschlossen. Etwas langsamer ist bisher die strukturelle Veränderung auf den Kapitalmärkten vor sich gegangen. Aber auch hier hat es in den letzten eineinhalb Jahren bedeutende Entwicklungen gegeben. Europas Kapitalmärkte befänden sich jedoch auch ohne Währungsunion im Umbruch. Globalisierung und neue technologische Entwicklungen haben bereits deutliche Spuren hinterlassen. Im Einzelnen dürfte es schwer fallen, die Ursachen spezifischer Veränderungen auf den Finanzmärkten zu identifizieren. Zweifellos hat aber die einheitliche Währung viele der neuen Entwicklungen, wenn nicht angestoßen, so doch verstärkt und beschleunigt. Insbesondere trägt sie zu liquideren und vollständigeren Finanzmärkten bei. Es wäre allerdings übertrieben zu erwarten, dass die Einführung des Euro von heute auf morgen zu einer Vereinheitlichung und vollständigen Integration aller nationalen Finanzmärkte führen würde. Strukturelle Unterschiede verschwinden nicht über Nacht.  In empirischen Studien wird der Entwicklungsgrad des Kapitalmarktes häufig im Vergleich zu den Vereinigten Staaten analysiert. Nicht zuletzt aufgrund unterschiedlicher rechtlicher und institutioneller Voraussetzungen erscheint eine vollständige Angleichung der Struktur der Euro-Kapitalmärkte an diejenige in den USA jedoch eher unwahrscheinlich. Dennoch gibt es erste Anzeichen einer Konvergenz im Sinne der Entwicklung einer verstärkt wertpapierorientierten Finanzstruktur im Euro-Währungsraum, in der langfristig die direkte Finanzierung über die Emission von Wertpapieren eine zunehmend größere Rolle im Vergleich zu unverbrieften Bankkrediten spielen könnte.  Bevor näher auf die strukturellen Entwicklungen der einzelnen Märkte eingegangen wird, sollte auf einen möglicherweise trivialen, aber trotzdem wichtigen Sachverhalt und dessen Konsequenz für Politik und Banken hingewiesen werden. Die Einführung des Euro hat im gesamten Euro-Währungsgebiet ein einheitliches Notenbank-Zinsniveau verwirklicht. Marktzinsen für Kredite oder Wertpapiere gleicher Laufzeiten unterscheiden sich nur noch wegen Unterschieden in der Bonität der Emittenten (bzw. der Kreditnehmer) und der Liquidität des betreffenden Marktes - von steuerpolitischen Aspekten einmal abgesehen. Inflationsdifferenzen und Wechselkurserwartungen entfallen im Euroraum als mögliche Ursache für Zinsunterschiede.  Generell herrscht in einem einheitlichen Währungsraum ein einheitliches Zinsniveau. Die allgemeinen Finanzierungsbedingungen sind damit gleich für alle Marktteilnehmer.  Unterschiede in der Effizienz der Banken und der Bonität der Kreditnehmer treten dadurch deutlich hervor. Da die Notenbankzinsen einheitlich für den Euroraum gelten, müssen die Kreditinstitute, deren Kreditvergabe stark regional konzentriert ist, etwaigen Sonderentwicklungen (wie z. B. regionalen Einbrüchen bei Immobilienpreisen und Konjunktur) in ihrem „Heimatmarkt\"" durch eine entsprechende Risikovorsorge Rechnung tragen.  Allgemein wird das Risikomanagement zunehmend auf die europäische Dimension ausgerichtet werden. Eine rein nationale Streuung von Vermögenspositionen und Sicherheiten für die Kreditvergabe wird zunehmend von der Euroraum-Dimension abgelöst. Eine solche Diversifikation kann dazu beitragen, das Gesamtrisiko gering zu halten.       Zur Zinsentwicklung    Vor den nachfolgenden Bemerkungen zur Struktur der Euro-Kapitalmärkte sind einige Anmerkungen zur Zinsentwicklung angebracht. Zu Beginn des Jahres 1999 hatten die Renditen für langfristige Staatschuldverschreibungen[3] im Euro-Währungsgebiet sowohl nominell als auch real historische Tiefstwerte erreicht. Nach 1995 waren die langfristigen Zinsen u. a. als Folge des auf Geldwertstabilität und Haushaltskonsolidierung ausgerichteten Konvergenzprozesses deutlich gefallen. Die resultierende Verringerung der Haushaltsdefizite im Euroraum sowie ein kontinuierlicher Rückgang der Preissteigerungsraten gingen mit sinkenden Nominal- und Realzinsen einher. Zu Beginn des Jahres 1999 haben aber auch die deutliche Eintrübung der Wachstumsaussichten für die Weltwirtschaft und das Euro-Gebiet sowie „Safe haven\""-Zuflüsse aus Schwellenländern zu sehr niedrigen langfristigen Euro-Zinsen beigetragen. Im Zuge einer zunehmenden Aufhellung der Wachstumsperspektiven sind die nominellen Renditen im Euroraum zwischen Mai und dem Jahresende 1999 um ungefähr 150 Basispunkte auf 5,5% angestiegen. Seit Beginn des Jahres 2000 schwankten die langfristigen Zinssätze im Wesentlichen zwischen 5,3% und 5,8%. Bemerkenswert ist, dass die 10-jährigen Euro-Zinsen nach wie vor deutlich unter den vergleichbaren US-Zinsen liegen (siehe Abbildung 1).  Das Euro-Zinsniveau für langfristige Staatsanleihen von rund 5½% signalisiert hohes Vertrauen der Finanzmärkte in die Stabilitätsorientierung der Geldpolitik der EZB und in die dieser Politik zugrunde liegende geldpolitische Strategie. Die mittel- und langfristigen Inflationserwartungen der Kapitalmarktteilnehmer lagen bisher meist unter 2% und stehen damit im Einklang mit der vom EZB-Rat festgelegten Definition von Preisstabilität[4]. Die Kapitalmärkte signalisieren damit auch die Erwartung der Anleger, die EZB werde rechtzeitig und angemessen allen Gefährdungen der Geldwertstabilität entgegentreten. Dieses Vertrauen in die Geldpolitik der EZB ist ein positiver Faktor für die Weiterentwicklung und die internationale Attraktivität der Euro-Finanzmärkte.       Finanzstruktur und Rolle der Kapitalmärkte in der Unternehmensfinanzierung    Prinzipiell lassen sich verschiedene Grundarten der Finanzstruktur unterscheiden. Für Kontinentaleuropa war lange Zeit die so genannte bankorientierte Finanzstruktur charakteristisch. Diese ist insbesondere dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass die Mittel zur Deckung des Fremdfinanzierungsbedarf des (nichtfinanziellen) privaten Sektors in erster Linie von Kreditinstituten in Form unverbriefter Kredite zur Verfügung gestellt werden. Ein Großteil der Unternehmensfinanzierung aus Fremdmitteln erfolgt in diesem Sinne indirekt, und nur ein kleiner Anteil des Finanzierungsbedarfs wird direkt über Kapitalmärkte mit Hilfe handelbarer Wertpapiere gedeckt.  In den USA und Großbritannien ist die Situation deutlich anders. Hier spielt die direkte Finanzierung über den Kapitalmarkt, d. h. in Form handelbarer Wertpapiere, eine wichtigere Rolle. Zudem sind bei der indirekten Finanzierung Nichtbanken wie Investitions- und Pensionsfonds als Finanzintermediäre bedeutende Partner. Diese Form wird häufig auch als wertpapier- oder marktorientierte Finanzstruktur bezeichnet. Ein wichtiges Merkmal dieser Finanzstruktur ist, dass nichtfinanzielle private Unternehmen ihren kurzfristigen Mittelbedarf insbesondere über Commercial Paper und ihren langfristigen Finanzierungsbedarf über Unternehmensanleihen (Corporate Bonds) oder Aktien decken. Außerdem lässt sich eine breite Verfügbarkeit von hoch entwickelten derivativen Instrumenten feststellen, während die Verwaltung des privaten Finanzvermögens (einschließlich der laufenden Sparbeträge) weniger von Banken, sondern zunehmend von anderen Institutionen wie etwa Versicherungsunternehmen, Pensionsfonds, Aktien- und Rentenfonds übernommen wird. Ein weiteres Kennzeichen dieser Finanzstruktur ist die Bedeutung der „Securitisation\"", d. h. der „Wertpapierunterlegung\"" oder „Verbriefung\"". Gemeint ist damit jener Prozess, bei dem Finanzintermediäre nichtliquide Vermögenswerte bündeln und darauf Wertpapiere begeben. Die Zins- und Tilgungszahlungen dieser Wertpapiere, die als Asset Backed Securities (ABS) bezeichnet werden, werden aus den Zahlungsströmen der zugrunde liegenden Forderungen bestritten.  Trotz deutlicher Veränderungen in den vergangenen Jahren kann die Finanzstruktur des Euro-Währungsgebietes immer noch als mehr oder weniger bankendominiert bezeichnet werden. Verfügbaren Daten zufolge (siehe Tabelle 1) hatten die ausstehenden inländischen Bankkredite 1999 einen etwas höheren Anteil gemessen am BIP (nämlich 102%) als die Finanzierung über die Emission inländischer Schuldverschreibungen (90% des BIP). Die Aktienmarktkapitalisierung in der Europäischen Währungsunion im Verhältnis zum BIP betrug im Dezember 1999 etwa 90%. Im Vergleich dazu überwog die ausstehende Finanzierung über die Emission inländischer Schuldverschreibungen in den Vereinigten Staaten gegenüber der Finanzierung über Banken deutlich (im September 1999 152% gegenüber 45% des BIP). Gemessen am BIP ist die Aktienmarktkapitalisierung in den Vereinigten Staaten (mit etwa 180% per Dezember 1999) doppelt so hoch wie im Euroraum.       Der Markt für inländische Schuldverschreibungen    Im September 1999 betrug der Umlauf inländischer Schuldverschreibungen im Euro-Währungsgebiet 5476 Mrd. Euro. Ein großer Teil davon, nämlich 61%, wurden von der öffentlichen Hand begeben (das sind 55% des BIP). Daneben spielten die privaten inländischen Schuldverschreibungen, die von Finanzinstituten emittiert werden, mit rund 35% des Gesamtumlaufs eine wesentlich wichtigere Rolle als jene, die vom (übrigen) Unternehmenssektor begeben wurden. Per Februar 2000 belief sich das ausstehende Volumen von in Euro denominierten inländischen Schuldverschreibungen von MFIs auf rund 2300 Mrd. Euro[5]. Der bedeutendste Sektor für private Anleihen im Euro-Währungsraum ist der Markt für deutsche Pfandbriefe, die von Kreditinstituten emittiert werden und durch Wohn bau kredite oder Kredite an den Staat (und seine Gebietskörperschaften) gedeckt sind. Das ausstehende Volumen dieser Papiere belief sich per Februar 2000 auf rund 800 Mrd. Euro[6].  Als geradezu spektakulär bei den in Euro denominierten Anleihen im vergangenen Jahr ist das rasche Anwachsen des Marktes für private Schuldverschreibungen (siehe Tabelle 2) zu bezeichnen. Die starke Emissionstätigkeit auf diesem Markt wurde vermutlich durch ein Umfeld niedriger langfristiger Zinsen begünstigt (vergleiche Abbildung 1).  In den USA war der Umlauf inländischer Schuldverschreibungen gemessen am BIP im September 1999 mit 152% um mehr als 60 Prozentpunkte höher als im Euro-Währungsraum (vergleiche Tabelle 1). Der Anteil der umlaufenden inländischen Schuldverschreibungen, die durch die öffentliche Hand begeben wurden, am gesamten Umlauf inländischer Schuldverschreibungen lag in den USA bei 55% und damit etwas niedriger als im Euroraum. Dagegen ist der Umlauf von privaten Anleihen, die von Nichtbanken begeben werden in den Vereinigten Staaten deutlich höher als im Euroraum (18% gegenüber 4% gemessen am Gesamtumlauf).       Inländische Schuldverschreibungen der öffentlichen Hand    Ein interessantes Strukturmerkmal des Anleihemarktes im Euro-Währungsgebiet ist, dass die Bruttoneuemissionen von Schuldverschreibungen durch die öffentliche Hand durchschnittlich niedriger sind als in den USA, obwohl das BIP der beiden Wirtschaftsräume annähernd gleich hoch ist und die Länder des Euroraumes durchschnittlich eine höhere Staatsschuldenquote aufweisen. Einer der Hauptgründe dafür ist, dass in den Ländern, die an der dritten Stufe der Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion teilnehmen, im Vergleich zu den USA ein größerer Teil der Staatsschuld in Form von Bankdarlehen finanziert wird[7].  Schätzungen zufolge betrug die durchschnittliche Laufzeit der staatlichen Schuldverschreibungen 1998 im Euro-Währungsgebiet zwischen 4 und 6 Jahre.[8] Seit etwa 1992 ist eine Konvergenz in der Laufzeitstruktur inländischer Schuldverschreibungen in Richtung längerer Laufzeiten zu beobachten. Dies kann insbesondere mit der Reduzierung der Unsicherheit über die zukünftige Inflationsentwicklung erklärt werden. In Italien, Portugal und Spanien zum Beispiel, wo die durchschnittliche Laufzeit zu Beginn der neunziger Jahre relativ niedrig war, ist sie deutlich angestiegen.  Grundsätzlich stellt eine Verlängerung der durchschnittlichen Laufzeit festverzinslicher Wertpapiere und Kredite eine positive Entwicklung dar. Im Verbund mit Geldwertstabilität tragen langfristige Finanzierungsbeziehungen im Allgemeinen zur Stabilität der Finanzmärkte bei. Eine glaubwürdig auf Preisstabilität ausgerichtete Geldpolitik kann ihrerseits einen wichtigen Beitrag zur Verbreitung längerer Laufzeiten leisten.  Seit Beginn der Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion sind Kreditrisikoprämien und Liquiditätsaspekte die eigentlichen Bestimmungsfaktoren für die Zinsdifferenzen zwischen Staatsanleihen in den Ländern des Euro-Währungsgebietes. Seit Januar 1999 überstiegen die Renditeabstände nur noch selten 30 Basispunkte. Zu den deutlich geringeren Renditeabständen zwischen den Anleihen der verschiedenen Teilnehmerstaaten trug auch der Fortschritt bei der Haushaltskonsolidierung der Einzelstaaten seit Beginn der neunziger Jahre bei. Ein Nachlassen bei den Anstrengungen zu dauerhafter Konsolidierung der öffentlichen Haushalte in einem Land könnte wegen der „no-bail-out\""-Klausel des Vertrages allerdings rasch zur Ausweitung der entsprechenden Kreditrisikoprämie führen.  Im Gefolge der Einführung des Euro haben die staatlichen Emittenten im Euro-Währungsgebiet ihre Emissionspolitik sowie organisatorische Aspekte, die die Funktionsfähigkeit und die Liquidität des Sekundärmarktes berühren, neu überdacht. Eine verstärkte Konvergenz der Emissionsverfahren hin zu möglichst effizienten Praktiken ist zu beobachten. Die durchgeführten (und die derzeit diskutierten) Reformen zielen in der Regel darauf ab, die Liquidität der begebenen Anleihen durch eine Erhöhung des Umfangs der einzelnen Emissionen zu erhöhen. Diese Reformen führten häufig zu besseren Marktzugangsbedingungen für ausländische Anleger.  Gemeinsame Anleiheemissionen verschiedener Staaten, und damit de facto eine Zusammenlegung von Kredit- oder Ausfallsrisiken der verschiedenen Regierungsschuldner bzw. Staaten in der Währungsunion, wie sie gelegentlich von Beobachtern vorgeschlagen wurden, würden jedoch in die falsche Richtung führen. Solche Maßnahmen könnten die Finanzdisziplin in der nationalen Budgetpolitik untergraben und zu Moral Hazard-Verhalten verleiten.       Inländische Schuldverschreibungen des privaten Sektors    Wie bereits erwähnt sind die Anleiheemissionen durch private Unternehmen, d. h. genauer durch private nichtfinanzielle Kapitalgesellschaften, im Jahr 1999 deutlich angestiegen. Die verstärkte Inanspruchnahme des Anleihemarktes durch den privaten Sektor ist auch am Rückgang des Anteils der von Monetären Finanzinstituten (MFIs)[9] an nichtfinanzielle Kapitalgesellschaften vergebenen unverbrieften Kredite an der gesamten Kreditgewährung der MFIs an den privaten Sektor zu erkennen. Verglichen mit den auf Euro lautenden Inlandskrediten im Euro-Währungsgebiet nimmt sich das Volumen der Euro-Anleiheemissionen des privaten Sektors allerdings immer noch relativ bescheiden aus.  Das spektakuläre Wachstum des Marktes für in Euro denominierte private Anleihen wurde von verschiedenen Faktoren gefördert. Neben der Einführung des Euro selbst haben andere wichtige Einflüsse wie die fortlaufende Umstrukturierung in der europäischen Unternehmenslandschaft zu einem größeren und liquideren Markt für private Anleihen geführt, der auch für einen erweiterten Kreis von Anlegern interessant ist. So gewann der Markt für private Euroanleihen mit der Emission großvolumiger Anleihen im Zusammenhang mit einer Reihe größerer Fusionen und Übernahmen in der ersten Jahreshälfte 1999 an Dynamik (siehe Tabelle 3). Die relativ problemlose Absorption dieser Emissionen kann als Indiz für die zunehmende Markttiefe gelten. Auch haben Kleinanleger aus Liquiditätsüberlegungen zunehmend indirekt Unternehmensanleihen über Investmentfonds erworben, was die Aufnahme großer Emissionen erleichtert hat.       Die Aktienmärkte    Die Börsenlandschaft verändert sich derzeit zweifellos in ausgeprägter Weise[10]. Es ist hier jedoch nicht der Ort, die neuesten Entwicklungen nachzuzeichnen.  Zu Beginn des Jahres 2000 gab es im EU-Raum 15 nationale Aktienbörsen, spezialisierte Börsen und solche mit ausschließlich regionaler Bedeutung nicht mitgerechnet[11]. Im Vergleich dazu gibt es derzeit in den Vereinigten Staaten 8 Börsen, wobei 95% des Geschäfts von der „New York Stock Exchange\"" (NYSE) und der NASDAQ[12] abgewickelt werden. Die relative Bedeutung der 15 Börsen in den EU Staaten unterscheidet sich deutlich. Fundamentale Differenzen betreffen ihre regionale Rolle, internationale Ausrichtung, Handelsverfahren und Rechtspersönlichkeit. Diese wiederum spiegeln Unterschiede in der Entstehung der Börsen, in den rechtlichen Rahmenbedingungen, in der Unternehmensfinanzierung und Aktionärsstruktur, in der Rolle der Finanzintermediäre und der Wettbewerbsposition der Finanzzentren wider.  Sowohl der Übergang zur dritten Stufe der Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion als auch die fortschreitende technologische Entwicklung haben 1999 Auswirkungen auf den Aktienmarkt im Euroraum gezeitigt. Die gesamte Marktkapitalisierung der Aktienmärkte des Euro-Währungsgebietes stieg Ende Dezember 1999 auf 5513 Mrd. Euro oder 90% des BIP (Tabelle 1), gegenüber 62% des BIP Ende 1998. Dies ist sowohl auf den Anstieg der Aktienkurse während dieses Zeitraumes als auch auf eine kontinuierliche Zunahme der Gesamtzahl der an den Börsen des Euroraumes notierten Unternehmen zurückzuführen (siehe Abbildung 2).  Die Gesamtanzahl der börsenotierten Unternehmen betrug Ende 1999 5386 für das Euro-Währungsgebiet (verglichen mit 7657 für die USA)[13]. Nach wie vor gibt es bedeutende Unterschiede zwischen den einzelnen EU-Ländern hinsichtlich der Aktienmarktkapitalisierung und der Anzahl der börsen notierten Unternehmen. Einige Indikatoren mögen dies veranschaulichen: Ende 1999 z. B. betrug die Aktienmarktkapitalisierung in Finnland in Prozent des BIP 289%[14] und war damit deutlich höher als in Großbritannien (206%) und in den USA[15] (180%). Ähnlich hoch war dieser Indikator mit 188% des BIP in den Niederlanden. Wie aus Abbildung 3 zu ersehen ist, betrug die Aktienmarktkapitalisierung gemessen am BIP im Vergleich dazu in den anderen Volkswirtschaften des Euro-Währungsgebietes rund die Hälfte bis ein Drittel (mit Ausnahme von Österreich, wo diese Maßzahl Ende 1999 nur 17% betrug).  Bemerkenswert ist auch die Entstehung von Aktienmärkten für die so genannten Wachstumsunternehmen sowie die grenzüberschreitende Kooperation zwischen diesen Märkten. Mittlerweile ist es für junge Unternehmen leichter geworden, sich Eigenkapital zu beschaffen. Für solche Unternehmen ist es in der Vergangenheit, unter anderem aufgrund mangelnder traditioneller Sicherheiten, häufig schwierig gewesen, Bankkredite zu erhalten.  1999 war am so genannten Euro.NM-Markt - einem gesamteuropäischen Zusammenschluss geregelter Börsen, der sich um Erstnotierungen von Unternehmen mit starkem Wachstumspotential bemüht - ein erhebliches Wachstum zu verzeichnen (vergleiche Abbildung 4). Ende 1999 umfasste diese Ende 1997 gegründete Vereinigung fünf europäische Aktienmärkte für Wachstumsunternehmen, i.e. Le Nouveau Marché in Paris, der Neue Markt in Frankfurt, NMAX in Amsterdam, die Euro.NM Belgium in Brüssel und der Nuovo Mercato in Mailand. Im Verlauf des Jahres 1999 ist die Gesamtzahl der an EURO.NM notierten Gesellschaften um 108%, nämlich von 165 auf 344, angestiegen. Im selben Zeitraum erhöhte sich die gesamte Aktienmarktkapitalisierung von 32 Mrd. Euro auf 135 Mrd. Euro und damit um über 300%.  Das starke Wachstum sollte nicht darüber hinwegtäuschen, dass - auch im Vergleich zur NASDAQ - die Bedeutung dieser Börsen in Europa freilich noch relativ gering ist. Zudem neigen diese Märkte immer wieder zu hoher Volatilität.       Neue Initiativen auf den Kapitalmärkten des Euro-Währungsraumes    Parallel zum Wachstum der Euro-Kapitalmärkte hat sich die Struktur der Unternehmensfinanzierung 1999 mit der Weiterentwicklung verschiedener Segmente der Kapitalmärkte des Euro-Währungsgebietes verbreitert. Insbesondere ist in diesem Zusammenhang das Wachstum des Marktes für hochrentierliche Anleihen zu erwähnen. Darunter sind jene Anleihen zu verstehen, die von Unternehmen mit einer niedrigeren Bonitätseinstufung, also einem höheren Ausfallrisiko, begeben werden. Dieser „Hochzinsmarkt\"" wurde durch die Zunahme privater Emissionen im Zusammenhang mit Fusionen und Übernahmen und Leveraged-Buy-Out-Aktivitäten sowie der starken Nachfrage institutioneller Anleger nach Anleihen mit höheren Renditen gefördert.  Insgesamt hat eine steigende Zahl relativ kleiner Unternehmen mit niedriger Bonität den Schritt gewagt, an den Markt für in Euro denominierte private Anleihen zu gehen, und Anleihen mit relativ hohen Renditen begeben. Private Anleiheemissionen, die von Moody's BAA oder niedriger eingestuft wurden, haben 1999 um 362% zugenommen (siehe Tabelle 4). Jedoch ist die Bedeutung der Emissionen von Unternehmen mit solchen niedrigen Ratings noch relativ gering, nämlich lediglich 0,3% des BIP (per Ende Dezember 1999).  Die starke Zunahme der Unternehmensfusionen und der Übernahmen im Euro-Währungsgebiet im Jahre 1999 hat auch den Markt für Kreditsyndizierungen belebt, an dem Kredite von einer Gruppe von Banken oder einem Bankenkonsortium gewährt werden, wenn der Kredit als zu groß angesehen wird, um von einer einzigen Bank vergeben zu werden. Die Vorteile von Konsortialkrediten bestehen darin, dass sie rascher dargestellt werden können als Emissionen von Schuldverschreibungen und dass Kreditzusagen storniert werden können, wenn die Fusion oder Übernahme nicht stattfindet.  In Europa ist der führende Markt für „Securitisation\"" bzw. die Verbriefung von Vermögenswerten jener in Großbritannien. Dieser Markt liegt weltweit gesehen an zweiter Stelle hinter dem US-Markt. Die kontinentaleuropäischen Länder sind in dieser Hinsicht noch nicht sehr weit entwickelt. Lange Zeit waren die Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) das dominierende Segment auf dem Markt für Asset Backed Securities (ABS). Das Instrument der Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) wurde in Europa Mitte der 1980er Jahre eingeführt. Pfandbriefe, wie sie vor allem von deutschen Hypothekenbanken begeben werden, gibt es jedoch bekanntlich schon sehr viel länger. Obwohl es sich auch bei Pfandbriefen um „forderungsunterlegte\"" Anleihetypen handelt, unterscheiden sich diese jedoch in verschiedenen Aspekten von MBS und ABS.[16]  In Europa sind französische Unternehmen nach den britischen die zweitgrößten Emittenten von Asset Backed Securities. Auch in anderen europäischen Ländern, einschließlich Spanien, Schweden und Italien wurden Asset Backed Securities begeben.[17] Empirische Untersuchungen[18] zeigen, dass der Markt für Asset Backed Securities in Europa zunächst relativ dynamisch eingeführt wurde. Mittlerweile wachsen die Emissionsvolumina jedoch verhältnismäßig langsam, was insbesondere darauf zurückgeführt wird, dass diese Verfahren der Wertpapierunterlegung noch vergleichsweise teuer sind.  Die Anleihederivate-Märkte, die sowohl der Kurssicherung als auch dem Eingehen von (spekulativen) Positionen dienen, haben sich in erster Linie aus Liquiditätserwägungen auf einen Kontrakt (den an der Eurex gehandelten Bund-Kontrakt) konzentriert. Außerdem wurden Zinsswaps zunehmend für Zwecke der Kurssicherung und die Ausnutzung von Kursanomalien verwendet. Des Weiteren wurden auf gesamteuropäischen Aktienindizes basierende Aktienfutures eingeführt, von denen der auf dem Dow-Jones-Euro-STOXX-Index basierende Kontrakt den höchsten Umsatz aufweist.  Außerdem wurden an den Kapitalmärkten des Euroraums neue elektronische Handelssysteme entwickelt. Diese neuen Systeme dürften die Effizienz und Transparenz der Märkte noch weiter verbessern.       Perspektiven    Der Übergang zur dritten Stufe der europäischen Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion mit der Einführung des Euro hat bedeutende Auswirkungen auf die Finanzstruktur im Euro-Währungsgebiet im Allgemeinen und die Euro-Kapitalmärkte im Besonderen. Es gibt einige Anzeichen dafür, dass sich im Euro-Währungsgebiet eine stärker wertpapier- oder marktorientierte Finanzstruktur entwickelt.  Wie eine Studie der niederländischen Zentralbank[19] ausführt, ist es durchaus möglich, dass sich Banken aus Ertragsüberlegungen weiter aus dem traditionellen Kreditgeschäft zurückziehen könnten. Empirische Untersuchungen zeigen, dass die Gewinnspannen der Banken im traditionellen Kreditgeschäft durchschnittlich relativ gering sind[20]. Die einheitliche Währung dürfte die Markttransparenz innerhalb der Währungsunion verstärken. Mit zunehmendem Wettbewerb im Bankensektor ist zu erwarten, dass die Banken in erster Linie jene Geschäfte abbauen werden, mit denen nur vergleichsweise niedrige Erträge zu erwirtschaften sind.  Der Bankensektor im Euroraum operiert - im Vergleich zu dem in den Vereinigten Staaten -stärker auf Marktsegmenten, die durch niedriges Risiko, aber auch niedrige Erträge gekennzeichnet sind. Der schärfere Wettbewerb dürfte die Banken zum Überdenken und einer Anpassung ihrer Preispolitik für Unternehmenskredite in Richtung einer stärkeren Marktorientierung anregen. Auch könnten die neuen Eigenmittelvorschriften des Basler Ausschuss für Bankenaufsicht[21] spürbare Auswirkungen in die gleiche Richtung haben. Bisher liegen die neuen Vorschriften nur als Vorschlag vor. Über ihre Implementierung wird auf europäischer Ebene diskutiert.  Mit der Einführung des Euro haben sich für institutionelle Investoren neue Möglichkeiten eröffnet. Viele der Lebensversicherungensunternehmen in Kontinentaleuropa z. B. investierten bisher einen Großteil ihrer Vermögenswerte in jenen Währungen, in denen sie auch ihre Versicherungsprämien erhielten und ihre Leistungen auszahlten. Vergleichbares galt in einigen Ländern, dazu zählten Dänemark, Deutschland, Finnland, Österreich und Italien, auch für Pensionsfonds. Da Prämien und Leistungen nun in Euro denominiert sind, haben institutionelle Investoren eine beträchtliche Ausweitung des Marktes in „eigener\"" Währung erfahren. Dies verändert das Anlageverhalten und führt zu Portfolioverschiebungen.  Viele Unternehmen sind nicht in der Lage, ihren gesamten Fremdfinanzierungsbedarf - oder auch nur einen Großteil davon - durch die Emission von börsennotierten Wertpapieren zu decken. Dies betrifft insbesondere viele kleinere und junge Unternehmen, aber auch Unternehmen ohne offizielles Rating. Während diese in der Vergangenheit häufig auf das klassische Bankdarlehen zurückgegriffen haben, könnte für sie in Zukunft verstärkt der nichtbörsennotierte Wertpapiermarkt an Attraktivität gewinnen. In Deutschland werden Unternehmensanleihen, deren Volumen - auch aufgrund der mittelständischen Unternehmensstruktur - bisher ohnedies eher gering ist, weitgehend am Over-The-Counter (OTC) Markt - und nicht an der Börse - gehandelt[22]. Nach einer Schätzung hat der Markt für solche nicht an der Börse notierte Wertpapiere in den Ländern der Währungsunion ein beachtliches Potential[23].  Wie bereits erwähnt, ist seit der Einführung des Euro auch im Euro-Währungsraum ein signifikanter Anstieg von Asset Backed Securities (einschließlich Mortgage Backed Securities) zu beobachten. Der Anstieg der Begebung von ABS und MBS-Instrumenten hat verschiedene europäische Regierungen dazu veranlasst, rechtliche Vorschriften einzuführen, die eine Weiterentwicklung dieser Märkte erleichtern sollen. Diese Entwicklungen sowie die Tatsache, dass bisher nur ein sehr kleiner Anteil von Hypothekar- und anderen Darlehen in Europa wertpapierunterlegt sind, könnten zu einem stark wachsenden Markt für diese Art von Wertpapieren in der nicht allzu fernen Zukunft führen.  Derzeit bestehen neben Gemeinsamkeiten in der Finanzstruktur noch deutliche Unterschiede zwischen den einzelnen an der Währungsunion teilnehmenden Ländern. Insbesondere gibt es immer noch einige Hindernisse, die einem weiteren Zusammenwachsen der Anleihemärkte der EU im Wege stehen. Eine ausreichende Harmonisierung der rechtlichen und steuerlichen Rahmenbedingungen einschließlich der Bilanzvorschriften, insbesondere auch für das Anleihesegment mit niedrigem Rating, eine angemessene Regelung der Depot- und Abwicklungsfragen sowie eine adäquate Harmonisierung der Regulierung und der rechtlichen Dokumentation des Repomarktes stehen noch aus. Im Gegensatz zur Bankenregulierung, wo die Bestimmungen in Form von Mindeststandards bereits vereinheitlicht sind, ist man bei der Wertpapierregulierung noch weit von einem gemeinsamen wettbewerbsrechtlichen Rahmen entfernt.  Dynamik und Stärke der Veränderungen auf den Kapitalmärkten werden durch den technischen Fortschritt, die Globalisierung und durch das Tempo des Strukturwandels im realen Sektor sowie insbesondere durch wirtschaftspolitische Reformen bestimmt. In Anbetracht der nach wie vor bestehenden institutionellen und rechtlichen Unterschiede zwischen den Ländern, die an der Währungsunion teilnehmen, ist ein eher gradueller Wandel wahrscheinlich[24]. Dies gilt insbesondere dann, wenn die notwendigen Reformen nicht zügig umgesetzt werden. Stärkere Verzögerungen in diesem Bereich dürften die Euro-Finanzmärkte allerdings im internationalen Wettbewerb schwächen. Dies gilt auch für eine Verschiebung der in vielen europäischen Ländern dringend notwendigen Reform der staatlichen Alterssicherungssysteme in Richtung auf eine verstärkte Kapitaldeckung. Hier liegt ein erhebliches Potential für die Entwicklung des Euro-Kapitalmarktes. Vor allem Pensionsfonds und fondsgebundene Lebens- und Rentenversicherungen könnten dann an Bedeutung zunehmen.  Ob all diese Veränderungen einen Funktions- und Bedeutungsverlust für die Banken im Euro-Währungsgebiet mit sich bringen, ist an dieser Stelle nicht zu beantworten. Sehr wahrscheinlich ist eine zunehmende Vielfalt der Finanzierungsformen und eine weitere Differenzierung der Intermediationsleistungen.       Fazit    Die Kapitalmärkte, auf denen Schuldverschreibungen und Aktien gehandelt werden, haben sich weltweit deutlich verändert. Die Märkte sind hinsichtlich Größe, Tiefe und Komplexität in neue Dimensionen gewachsen. Auch Europas Kapitalmärkte befinden sich im Umbruch.  Seit Beginn 1999 hat sich die Finanzstruktur des Euro-Währungsgebietes spürbar in Richtung einer stärker wertpapier- und marktorientierten Struktur verändert und wird damit jener in den USA und in Großbritannien tendenziell ähnlicher. Sowohl Anleihe- als auch Aktienmärkte haben an Volumen, Breite und Liquidität gewonnen. Bemerkenswert ist insbesondere, dass die direkte Unternehmensfinanzierung über Kapitalmärkte zugenommen hat. Auch scheinen sich der Grad der Wertpapierunterlegung und der Disintermediationsgrad vergrößert zu haben.  Das rasche Wachstum der Märkte für auf Euro lautende private Anleihen und die damit verbundene Zunahme von Finanzinstrumenten wie Anleihen mit hohen Renditen haben die Möglichkeiten der Unternehmensfinanzierung und das Spektrum für Anleger im Euroraum erweitert. Diese Entwicklung ist alles andere als abgeschlossen. Die Aktien- und Unternehmensanleihemärkte sind im gesamten Euroraum derzeit noch eindeutig weniger bedeutend als in den USA und Großbritannien. Andererseits dominieren im Euroraum nach wie vor langfristig vereinbarte Finanzierungsbedingungen.  Grundsätzlich sind relativ lange Laufzeiten sowie ein geringer Anteil variabel verzinslicher, kurzfristiger Kredite und Wertpapiere positiv zu beurteilen. Lange Laufzeiten von Festzinsanleihen des öffentlichen Sektors erleichtern die Umsetzung einer stabilitätsorientierten Geldpolitik und isolieren die Budgetdefizite von Schwankungen der kurzfristigen Zinsen. Damit nimmt auch die Wahrscheinlichkeit ab, dass Regierungen Druck auf das Eurosystem auszuüben versuchen, die Zinsen möglichst niedrig zu halten.  Nicht nur aus geldpolitischer Sicht sind relativ lange durchschnittliche Laufzeiten bei festverzinslichen Wertpapier- und Kreditverträgen vorteilhaft. Die reale Verzinsung dieser Kredite hängt nicht von Schwankungen der Zinsen während der Vertragslaufzeit ab, sondern lediglich von der Entwicklung der Inflation über diesen Zeitraum. Im Verbund mit Geldwertstabilität erhöht eine längere Zinsbindungsdauer generell die langfristige Planungssicherheit von Investoren und Konsumenten. Eine glaubwürdige Ausrichtung der Geldpolitik auf die Erhaltung der Preisstabilität reduziert folglich das „Realzinsrisiko\"" langfristiger Kredite und trägt deshalb generell zu langfristigen Finanzierungsformen bzw. einer längeren Zinsbindungsdauer bei. Langfristige Finanzierungsverträge und lange durchschnittliche Laufzeiten von Festzinsanleihen sind daher auch ein deutlicher Vertrauensbeweis für die stabilitätsorientierte Geldpolitik. Gleichzeitig steigt mit zunehmender Zinsbindungsdauer die ohnehin schon wichtige Rolle dauerhafter Preisstabilität (und damit geringer Inflationsunsicherheit) für die Wohlfahrt der Anleger wie der Kreditnehmer.  Die Erhaltung der Geldwertstabilität ist somit von zentraler Bedeutung für die Finanzierung langfristiger Investitionsprojekte und vor allem für die kapitalgebundene Altersvorsorge. Für den EZB-Rat wird bei seinen Entscheidungen die damit verbundene Verantwortung immer im Mittelpunkt stehen.       Literatur     Bhattacharya, A. K. and F. J.

"12","\""E-economy: will we still need banks in the future?\""   Speech by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at the XVIIth German Banking Congress, Berlin on 4 April 2001 Ladies and Gentlemen,  I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak here at the Deutscher Bankentag in Berlin today. It is a great pleasure to address so many bank leaders operating in the German - and of course, by implication the European - economy.  One of the most striking economic events of the last years has been the pace and depth of change in information and telecommunication technologies, of which the development of electronic money is a good example. Some claim that these developments in information and telecommunication technologies have triggered a New Economy. In my remarks today, I would like to first discuss the economic opportunities being created by the potential emergence of this New Economy in the euro area. In a second part, I will more specifically review the development of electronic finance.  There is no undisputed and unequivocal definition of what should be understood by the term \""New Economy\"". As a central banker, I would like to trace a sharp distinction between a more popular notion of the New Economy and a more fundamental vision. The more popular notion of the New Economy that could be mainly found in the press covers a wide spectrum of statements. For example, it was sometimes claimed that stock market prices had reached a permanently higher plateau and that further exceptional rises were to come. Others claimed the death of the business cycle or, in a more realistic version, that business cycle fluctuations could now be expected to be significantly and permanently dampened by the emergence of a New Economy. We cannot fully judge this at the current stage. And uncertainties regarding global economic developments have more or less pushed the discussion about the New Economy into the background. Therefore, in my comments, I shall adopt a rather cautious approach and address the more fundamental issues related to the New Economy. In my interpretation of the debate, there are two main components in the concept of the New Economy. These relate, first, to the way in which the New Economy manifests itself and, second, to the conjunctions of particular events that accompany the emergence of the New Economy. First, the New Economy is seen as leading to a permanently higher rate of potential output growth, with productivity gains driven by technological innovation being the main motor behind the upsurge. The increase in productivity growth that has been regarded as characterising the New Economy is typically seen as the result of an underlying economic process which may take some time to bear fruit and therefore may clearly precede the emergence of the symptoms of the New Economy in macroeconomic data. Increased investment in computers, software, peripheral equipment, network infrastructure and other information and communication technologies are generally regarded as the most salient driving force behind what has been perceived as a new pattern of growth. Second, the New Economy is seen as being closely associated with the processes of deregulation, particularly in labour markets and network industries such as telecommunications, and globalisation, particularly in financial markets.  Other accompanying conditions, such as increased competition and flexibility in domestic goods and factor markets, as well as a stable macroeconomic environment, are also indispensable components of the same picture, if not equally powerful determinants of the phenomenon. They allow the full potential of technological innovation to be exploited and ensure that a faster pace of economic expansion and employment can be achieved on a more sustained basis and without destabilising inflationary pressures.  The ECB cannot, however, \""create\"" a New Economy through its monetary policy. The New Economy depends mainly on technological progress and the liberalisation of markets. However, the ECB can provide a positive contribution to growth and employment prospects by safeguarding price stability. Maintaining price stability is the ECB's primary objective. Unfortunately, this is sometimes forgotten. In the long run, pursuing this objective will help the economy to enhance its growth potential. In this context, the Governing Council of the ECB, at its meeting last Thursday, confirmed the \""wait and see\"" position with regard to the monetary policy stance. In an environment of increased uncertainty about the global economy and its impact on the euro area, the Governing Council is carefully assessing whether and to what extent upward risks to price stability will continue to decline. As far as the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy is concerned, the decrease of money growth indicates that upward risks to price stability have receded. As for the second pillar, domestic upward price pressures may decrease as a result of somewhat lower than expected GDP growth in the euro area. However, due to the risk of secound-round effects from past oil price increases, wage developments will be monitored carefully, as these might result in upward price pressures.  In the financial sphere, the advances in information and telecommunication technologies have started to have their effects. This was perhaps even more visible than in the non-financial sphere. In the banking sector, a development that has attracted considerable attention over recent years is the emergence of internet banking. The first financial products and services to be distributed over the Internet were rather standardised ones, in fields such as securities brokerage and payment services. More recently, a wider array of financial products and services have become available over the internet, which has thus become an important distribution channel for a number of banks. Many banks in the euro area have already developed the internet channel to various degrees. There even exist some banks with few or no physical branches, which rely on the internet and the telephone as their main channels of communication with clients. In general, the development of internet banking appears likely to reduce the franchise value of banks as it contributes to an intensification of competition in the banking sector. Certain commentators even consider that competitive pressure may lead to the separation of various banking activities traditionally performed under the same roof. In the view of these commentators, activities such as deposit taking, payment services and lending could be split up because Internet banking would diminish the traditional synergies between them. What I would like to bear in mind from the discussion on this issue is that, with new information and communication technologies, business practices in the banking industry can be expected to evolve considerably in the near future. For example, advances in data processing as well as in business models may make it possible for banks to make more efficient use of information on customers' business habits, and apply e.g. new credit scoring and other methods of analysis. Customers are likely to benefit from these developments in several ways. Thanks to intensified competition, they are likely to get better and more efficient financial products and services. In particular, new technology such as home banking should contribute to reducing the time and effort spent by customers in purchasing financial products and services. Under the influence of changes in banking practices, customers may be able to have access to a wider range of financial products and services. Furthermore, efficiency gains will allow products to be offered at lower prices. In the euro area, electronic finance thus compounds the effects of the creation of the single currency, adding impetus to progress towards integrated financial markets at an area-wide level. Monetary policy needs to take account of these developments. In particular, it is important to monitor the resulting modifications to the financial structure of the economy so as to be able to track changes in investor behaviour, not least in order to assess the transmission channels of monetary policy. Moreover, in this context the possibility of excessive risk taking in the banking sector should not be neglected. Faced with eroding margins in \""old businesses\"", banks may develop their activities in heretofore unexplored fields, by geographical expansion or by product development. In such circumstances, some banks may misjudge the risks inherent in the new activities, as a result of a lack of information, knowledge or skill. In such a situation, the prudential supervision of banks can help by assessing whether the capital buffers of banks remain sufficient for the banking sector as a whole. In financial markets, the issues are broadly similar. It is widely recognised that financial markets have been significantly transformed by the emergence of on-line brokers and electronic trading systems over recent years. In general, these developments have the potential to improve the functioning of financial markets. For example, on-line brokers often provide clients with detailed information regarding market conditions and the execution of orders. Greater transparency on the part of brokers reduces the information asymmetry between brokers and customers. As a result, customers may be able to obtain better execution prices, not least because they can more easily see the prices quoted by various brokers. Although the electronification of financial markets can bring benefits to customers, some risks are also associated with it. The first type of risk is by nature operational. Advances in information and telecommunications technologies have made it easier than ever before to set up exchanges for financial products, for example on the internet. In the early stages of their development, the new trading systems need to be thoroughly tested so as to ensure maximum security. In particular, it is important for them to be able to withstand turbulent market conditions, including periods of exceptionally high trading activity and market volatility. The second kind of risk arises from the possibility of a disorderly segmentation of financial markets. As new trading systems are developed, the possibility exists that trading activity becomes spread over a number of exchanges. Competition between exchanges is generally beneficial. However, customers may, at least over a transitory period, be faced with some difficulties in accessing the new exchanges. Until the changeover is complete, customers may thus be unable to always obtain the best execution prices. In order to deal with this problem, it is important that the new exchanges establish clear rules regarding participation and price quotation as soon as possible in the process of starting their operations. Finally, I would like to say a few words about electronic money. E-money is still very much in its infancy but has the potential to develop. In the euro area, various e-money schemes exist. Although the volume of e-money in circulation currently remains very low in the euro area, the number of devices already in circulation suggests that usage could expand rapidly (\""Issues arising from the emergence of electronic money\"", November 2000 edition of the Monthly Bulletin of the ECB, p.49-60.) In this context, it was important that the regulatory framework was clearly set up at an early stage so as to reduce uncertainty. In my view, this will encourage innovation. I am glad to say that the framework adopted in the European Union has the advantage of ensuring a high measure of security for customers, in particular through providing protection against counterfeiting and money laundering. For monetary policy, there are three main issues arising from the emergence of electronic money. First, it is important that electronic money does not jeopardise the unit of account function of money. In other words, electronic euros stored on a payment card must have the same value irrespective of when and by whom the card was issued. This important principle has been safeguarded in European legislation through the imposition of a redeemability requirement for e-money. Second, monetary policy must remain able to steer money market interest rates. I believe that this will continue to be the case as long as money market participants need to have recourse to the central bank for providing the final means of settlement. Third, electronic money, as a close substitute for banknotes and coins, needs to be included in the definition of monetary aggregates. Therefore, even though e-money currently remains in its infancy, the ECB has started to collect data on the amounts of electronic money in circulation. Without going into further details on these issues, let me emphasise that we are confident that electronic money will not pose risks to the ECB in the pursuit of its objectives.  To conclude my remarks today, I would just recall that, in particular in the financial sphere, remarkable changes have taken place already. Banks have developed new products and services as well as new ways to commercialise them. Financial markets have been transformed by the emergence of electronic trading systems.  These developments can be a source of great benefits since they generally tend to augment the range of options available to borrowers and investors. This may contribute to a better allocation of financial resources in the economy and, thereby, eventually to higher economic growth. As in all periods of rapid change, there are some risks associated with the developments currently underway. However, I am confident that these risks can be addressed satisfactorily, allowing the euro area to reap the benefits of e-finance.",1
"13","\""Priorities of the Belgian Presidency of the EU for the financial services area\""   Speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the EUROFI Conference, Brussels, 28 September 2010  Introduction “While the Committee [of wise men] strongly believes that large, deep, liquid, and innovative financial markets will result in substantial gains and therefore bring individual benefits to European citizens, it also believes that greater efficiency does not necessarily go hand in hand with enhanced stability. Increased integration of securities markets entails more interconnection between financial intermediaries on a cross border basis, increasing their exposure to common shocks […] the Committee believes that there is an urgent need to strengthen cooperation at the European level between financial market regulators and the institutions in charge of micro and macro prudential supervision.”  What reads like a quote from the year 2010, actually comes from a report written by The Committee of Wise Men on the Regulation of European Securities Markets under the chairmanship of Alexandre Lamfalussy in 2001 and very well reflects challenges that we are still facing today and we are about to address in the wake of the current crisis.  So let me give you briefly my views on where I see the major priorities in the financial services area. The first one concerns addressing the regulatory lessons from the crisis with respect to micro and macro-prudential supervision. The second one is the strengthening of market infrastructures, the strive for more transparency and to minimize contagion risks and, specifically, the setting up of infrastructures for OTC derivatives. The third priority I see in the field of retail payments, where more harmonization and integration can make the retail payments market faster, safer and more efficient.   1. Supervision and Regulation (including ESRB) So let me turn to the first priority on supervision and regulation: A wide consensus that action was urgently necessary to remedy the gaps of the regulatory and supervisory framework highlighted by the financial crisis has pushed the global regulatory community into reflections on necessary actions. I welcome that the regulatory community is delivering what I believe would be significant steps forward in increasing the resilience of the financial sector.   The agreement reached on the Basel III framework constitutes a fundamental strengthening of global regulatory standards. I am of the view that the agreed reform strikes the right balance between the overall objective of strengthening the resilience of the financial sector and thus creating a sounder banking and financial system on the one hand and avoiding unduly severe implications on national banking systems and the real economy. With respect to the much debated phasing-in and transition arrangements, in my view they are realistic. Since the start of the crisis banks have significantly raised their capital levels, and in order for the banks to meet the new standards, large bank will need to raise a significant amount of further capital. Therefore, a reasonable balance was found between country specific considerations and the need to achieve a consistent international application of measures without hampering the economic recovery. And I think, broadly speaking, the right balance has been found. Besides the swift implementation of the Basel rules, I see a critical priority as well in the field of reforming financial institution’s corporate governance and risk management practises.  Turning to Europe, I would like to highlight two main policy actions that should be considered of utmost priority. First, the starting of the ESRB and the European Supervisory Authorities. The agreement reached on the legislative package concerning the ESRB and the ESAs is strongly welcomed by the ECB. The ECB shall ensure a Secretariat and thereby provide analytical, statistical, logistical and administrative support to the ESRB. As the time of the establishment of the ESRB is approaching, the ECB is now getting ready to support the new body which will become operational as of 1 January next year. In particular, we need to ensure the availability of critical data and information, which will be a crucial basis for any future detection and analysis of systemic risk. In this regard, it will also be essential to further develop modern tools for the measurement and the early warning of systemic risk.   Second, the enhancement of the EU crisis management and resolution framework. The ECB follows with particular attention all the ongoing initiatives aiming at introducing fundamental changes to the financial stability arrangements. In forthcoming weeks, the Commission is expected to release a new communication on crisis management including many proposals for a fundamental reform, which will inevitably imply - in the medium term - important changes in the national legal frameworks. I strongly support the efforts of the Commission as I think that a sound framework on crisis management that would strengthen and harmonise the powers of the authorities and improve the institutional setting (e.g. the establishment of the Cross Border Financial Stability Groups) and other elements, including the possible set up of resolution funds under a harmonised framework of operation are necessary steps in view of enhancing the crisis management and resolution framework.   2. OTC Derivative regulation  Let me turn to the second major priority: the strengthening of market infrastructures to increase market transparency and to limit contagion.  One specific priority in this regard for the coming months is the timely adoption and implementation of a new EU regulatory framework for OTC derivatives central counterparties and trade repositories. The issue is urgent both to enhance the use of these infrastructures and to ensure their safe and efficient functioning. The recently issued Commission legislative proposal is an important step towards achieving these objectives. At the same time, the ECB still sees a need for improvement of the draft regulation. Let me just highlight three of them. First, while access to central bank liquidity is a particularly robust arrangement for enhancing the liquidity resilience of CCPs, it is crucial to keep in mind that the decision to grant such access has to remain entirely subject to central banking discretion, owing to the potential for direct monetary policy implications. In this regard, let me recall that the first line of defence, including for distressed market conditions, must always be the appropriate liquidity risk management of the CCPs themselves.  Second, existing responsibilities with regard to CCPs need to be regarded. Given that CCPs are subject to various types of regulation, oversight and supervision, it would not be appropriate to confer major EU decision-making powers, such as for the specification of prudential requirements and for the recognition of third country CCPs, to a single EU body that does not fully reflect and represent these different functions. In particular, ESMA should closely cooperate with the ESCB on all oversight-related matters. Third, given the critical importance of a global regulatory level playing field for both CCPs and trade repositories, EU rules should go much further in requiring, in the course of their specification through implementing measures, close convergence with the existing global standards for financial market infrastructures. Again in close cooperation with the ESCB.  3. SEPA end date regulation.  Turning to the third major priority: a harmonized and integrated retail payment market through the implementation of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) The Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) – which the ECB promotes together with the European Commission - will enable customers to make cashless payments throughout the euro area with a single set of payment instruments. The ECOFIN Council has recognized in March last year that the cost savings to business and consumers can amount up to EUR 18 bn annually. Despite the substantial benefits of the SEPA project, migration has been very slow; figures from June 2010 show that only 8.8% of all euro area credit transfers were processed as SEPA credit transfers and only 0.05% of all euro area direct debits were processed as SEPA direct debits.  In fact, we see that the migration to SEPA in a self-regulated way has not achieved the required results. The banking industry’s self-imposed deadline of December 2010 for SEPA instruments to be in general usage will not be met.  Therefore, the Eurosystem has now for some time emphasised the need for a realistic but ambitious end date to be set for the migration to SEPA credit transfer and SEPA direct debit, in order to fully reap the benefits of SEPA.  To ensure the materialisation of SEPA benefits, a migration end date by regulation for SEPA credit transfer and SEPA direct debit is necessary and should be set by the EU legislator. The Eurosystem does, therefore, welcome and support the Commission’s suggestion to introduce an end-date for migration to SEPA credit transfers and SEPA direct debits by means of an EU regulation. If the Commission decides to move forward by presenting a legal proposal for setting an end date, I would like to emphasise the importance of a wide support and a smooth adoption. I, therefore, hope that the Belgian Presidency, EU Member States and the EU Parliament would give any legal proposal high priority and due attention. A legally binding instrument is from my point of view necessary for a successful migration to SEPA as the project would otherwise face the risk of failure.

"14","\""The euro - a world currency\""   Dr. Sirkka Hämäläinen, Member of the Executive Board, The Hochschule für Bankwirtschaft, Frankfurt am Main, 13 November 2002   Introduction   Ladies and gentlemen,  First of all, I should like to thank the Hochschule f  ü  r Bankwirtschaft for the invitation to address you tonight. It is a great pleasure and honour for me to be here.  The title of my presentation, \""the euro - a world currency\"", could understandably conjure up visions of the past for the banking community and financial centre of Frankfurt am Main , of which you represent a broad cross-section. Indeed, the oldest record of financial activity in Frankfurt dates back to 794, when the Emperor Charlemagne launched a new form of money here, the denarius, which he intended to become a universal currency.  The euro does not nourish such ambitions, of course. Its exclusive purpose is to be the currency of the citizens of the European Union (EU), and as such to serve them well. Whether it develops a role as an international currency is not, per se, a cause for concern or any policy objective. We at the European Central Bank have often said that we do not see - in our capacity as guardians of the integrity of money - any need to either foster or hinder the internationalisation of the euro. Whether the euro develops an international role or not has little bearing on our task and ability to maintain price stability and financial stability in the euro area.  However, the fact that the international role of the euro is not a cause for concern does not mean that it should not be a matter of keen interest. This question has naturally attracted a considerable amount of attention over the past few years, and rightly so. I could give you many justifications for this interest, but let me at this stage mention just one: not being any kind of policy objective, an international role for the euro is left to market forces. This means that all elements and developments are determined by the market and these developments provide us with valuable information on how effective and competitive a currency the euro is perceived to be by international market participants.  There is no doubt that a domestic perspective and domestic factors are very relevant when assessing how much and why the euro is used internationally. The domestic perspective of the international role of the currency is to be my main focus this evening.  I shall group my remarks into three areas:      first, I should like to consider from a conceptual perspective what it means for a currency to be international and what factors would make it international;    second, I will briefly recall some facts and figures to demonstrate the extent to which the euro is already being used internationally; and,    third, I will attempt to look at the euro from a domestic perspective and draw lessons and conclusions on the overall significance of the euro.       I  An international currency from a domestic perspective   What is an international currency, and why is it interesting to analyse one from a domestic perspective? To answer this question, it is useful to look at both the similarities and the differences between an international and a domestic currency.   The common purpose of domestic and international money   Both a domestic and an international currency, of course, meet similar needs: without money, trade is very limited - as William Stanley Jevons put it in the last century - by the need for \""double coincidence of wants\"" [1] . In the absence of money, a transaction takes place only if each party wants to acquire exactly what the other wants to sell. Money, as a common unit of account, as a means of exchange and as a store of value, facilitates economic development by removing the constraints of barter.  This is also true at the international level. In a world with many currencies, international trade and foreign exchange transactions would also be hampered by the constraint of \""double coincidence of wants\"". An international currency plays the same role at the global level that a domestic currency plays at the local level.  International money is as old as international trade. The denarius of Charlemagne was intended to replace the bezant of the Byzantine empire, a gold coin \""accepted everywhere from end to end of the earth' according to a chronicle of the 7th century [2] .   The difference between domestic and international money   There is, however, a fundamental difference between domestic and international money with regard to how the co-ordination of the choice of this medium of exchange is realised. Money, whatever form it takes, has hardly ever had any intrinsic value. Its value derives from the fact that it is commonly accepted as a medium of exchange. Through history, money has taken various forms, such as stones, metals, paper or electronic entries on the books of a bank. Whatever shape it takes, a co­ ordinated agreement within the community of its users is always needed.  At the domestic level, this agreement is nowadays typically of a constitutional nature. The decisions concerning the currency are made by the political authority and backed by its power. And the status of legal tender is conferred exclusively to the \""domestic\"" currency of this political authority.  Before the single currency, the euro, the domestic currencies in Europe generally coincided with the sovereign states. Since the birth of the euro, the \""domestic\"" area of the currency is now the area of 12 sovereign states which have combined their political authority in the monetary field via the EU decision-making bodies. The Maastricht Treaty unequivocally established that \""the banknotes issued by the ECB [  …  ] shall be the only such  notes to have the status of legal tender within the Community\"".   By contrast, for international transactions, there is no comparable political body presiding over the choice of the medium of exchange. The selection of an international currency is therefore of a conventional nature. This means that it is chosen by the accord of participants in the market. In other words, the choice of an international currency is not determined by the issuer of the currency, but by its users. The main difference between national and international money can thus be described by the fact that the former is supply-driven, the latter demand-driven. The choice of an international currency or currencies is the result of competition between the various national or domestic currencies on the basis of efficiency, that is to say how well a particular currency serves the purpose of a medium of exchange, a unit of account and a store of value for the international market.   Information derived from the international performance of a currency   There is a natural correlation between a currency's performance of its domestic roles as unit of account, medium of exchange and store of value and the fact that it is perceived as an internationally used and accepted currency.  The international use of a currency must be seen in this context as an indicator, a measure of performance concerning its success as a domestic currency. For performance analysis it is interesting to distinguish the factors of relevance to the choice of an international currency and to clarify their domestic implications and prerequisites. Let me try to consider some of these factors by associating them with the three roles of money - a unit of account, a medium of exchange and a store of value.   A currency and the roles of money   A first element that will determine how attractive a currency is to international market participants is how effective it is as a unit of account and also as a store of value. In our world of fiduciary monies, both notions are related to the same concept, which is, in essence, price stability.  To be perceived as sound and attractive, from an international as well as from a domestic perspective, a currency's value must be perceived as stable when measured against goods and services. This is a straightforward definition of price stability. During a famous debate in 1811 in the United Kingdom , David Ricardo expressed his view on what made a good currency in the following terms: \""it [is] most justly contended  that, to be perfect, a currency should be absolutely invariable in value\"" [3] .   The international attractiveness of a currency is naturally also very much dependent on its effectiveness as a means of exchange. This notion can be closely related to the level of development and soundness of the overall domestic financial system of that currency.  The use of a currency and its effectiveness are not, of course, limited to the money issued by the central bank. They cover the whole financial system from the banking sector with its commercial bank money to securities markets. The efficiency and soundness of a currency as a means of exchange relies on the efficiency and soundness of all the financial market-players from banks, other financial intermediaries and financial services companies to stock exchanges, clearing houses and securities settlement systems.  The efficient infrastructure, liquidity or the deepness of all the market segments and the existence of a broad array of financial instruments increase the range of opportunities for international market participants to raise capital, invest funds and manage their financial risk in a particular currency. And the existence of deep markets results in low costs in financial transactions, which in turn makes it more attractive to conduct business in that currency. All this is even more important for the economic performance of the domestic economies: the efficient allocation of savings to investments is one of the crucial structural conditions for higher growth.  History teaches us that important preconditions for the attractiveness of a currency internationally are the efficiency and stability of the political entity of the currency as well as policy sustainability, especially in economic terms - or, more exactly, the perception of these. Political and economic decision-making that is efficient, disciplined and based on continuity and transparency supports the long-term planning of economic agents and players. They guarantee - in the wider sense - the capacity of the currency to fulfil its task as a store of value.  The task as a store of value of the currency is, in the same vein, very much dependent on the degree of efficiency, productivity and flexibility, not only of policy-making, but also of the economy at large. The structural improvements which increase the longer-term growth potential of the economy benefit the domestic economy in particular, but they also improve the attractiveness of the area for investment, and therefore the attractiveness of holding its currency, too.  For borrowers it is sufficient to have reasonable liquidity and reasonably low borrowing costs. Investors are interested in income prospects in addition to having highly efficient and liquid financial markets and credible stable and efficient economic policy-making. These income prospects sought by investors in the medium term in particular are closely linked to relative productivity developments vis-a-vis other currency areas.   Additional conditions   The degree of openness of an economy and its share in international trade naturally influence the use of the currency internationally. This goes a long way towards explaining the successive dominance of various currencies over the centuries. The bezant of the Byzantine empire in the early Middle Ages was followed by, inter alia, the currencies of Venice and Florence in the late Middle Ages, the Dutch guilder in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the pound sterling in the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century and, finally, the US dollar for the better part of the last century.  Historically it has been evident that, while several currencies can function in parallel with an international role, changes in the dominant currency are typically scarce and slow to materialise, in spite of the underlying factors that could in principle justify such a change.  The replacement of the pound sterling by the US dollar as the dominant currency in international markets, for instance, took place only very gradually over more than half a century, starting around the end of the First World War. This change was only completed well after the United States had established itself as the largest economic and trade bloc in the world and well after the US financial markets had become the deepest and the most liquid.    2. A snapshot of the international role of the euro so far   Let me move now to the second, more concrete part of my presentation. What international role has the euro been playing so far?  For comparison, let me recall some basic \""magnitudes\"": the euro is currently the currency of 300 million Europeans, who together account for more than 15% of world GDP, and almost 20% of international trade. This makes the euro area the second largest economy in the world after the United States .  This is the situation at present. But, as you know, the euro has the vocation to serve, ultimately, the entire EU, and the EU is enlarging to take in 12 new members this decade. The euro's coverage as a currency therefore has the potential to widen even further - by 60% in terms of population and by 35% in terms of GDP if and when all three non- participating EU Member States and all the current accession countries adopt the single currency in the years to come.  In view of these figures, it is only natural that the euro should play a global role. In addition, the euro \""inherited\"" an international role from several of its legacy currencies, and primarily, of course, the Deutsche Mark. Indeed, the euro is used internationally - that is, by residents outside the euro area - to a considerable extent. It is used as a currency of investment and funding by both private and public sector entities. It is used as an anchor currency for many small currencies and as a foreign reserve and intervention currency by authorities in a number of countries. It is also used as a parallel currency by private individuals in a few countries neighbouring the EU. To some extent, the euro is also used for invoicing in international trade transactions, and as a vehicle currency in some segments of the global foreign exchange markets.  Let me briefly review the use of the euro in some areas usually considered relevant for assessing the international role of a currency. Here I would like to refer to the publication entitled \""Review of the  international role of the euro\"", which the ECB published in September 2001 and which contains an extensive description of the trends I am about to mention. An updated version will be published in early December and this information will be made available on a regular basis in the future.  The euro has so far been much more interesting to market players as a currency for financing than as an investment currency or as a transaction and pricing currency.  As a funding currency, the euro took up a very significant role almost immediately after its introduction, and this role is continuing to grow steadily. According to the figures of mid 2002, the share of the euro in the announced issuance of international money market instruments is, at 36% of global issuance, broadly equal to the 38% accounted for by the US dollar. Borrowing on the euro denominated bond markets has doubled by mid-2002: the euro was then the currency of denomination for 39% of international debt securities. By comparison, the current share of the US dollar is 45% and that of the Japanese yen is 6%.  The reasons for the increase in the relative share of the euro in borrowing markets since 1998 are evident. The lower liquidity risk and foreign exchange risk premia, deeper markets that allow larger issue sizes, and tighter competition among intermediaries have all lowered borrowing costs.  The role of the euro as a vehicle currency in the foreign exchange market is much more modest. The euro appears on one side or the other of 43% of foreign exchange transactions. This remains substantially below the role taken up by the US dollar, which appears on one side or the other of 84% of transactions. However, also on this count, the euro is the second most often used currency.  In some segments of the foreign exchange market, however, the euro is the primary vehicle currency. This is particularly true vis-a-vis currencies of countries neighbouring the euro area or those with strong institutional links with the EU, such as the accession countries. It should also be recalled that the euro plays a role in the exchange rate policies of many third countries: around 50 countries include the euro in their exchange rate policies as an anchor or reference currency. Most of these countries, however, are relatively small.  As I mentioned earlier, the euro has been more popular as a financing currency than as an investment currency even though, here too, some growth can be seen. We do not have detailed statistical data on private investment, just anecdotal evidence indicating that it has been increasing slowly. In total official reserves, the euro currently accounts for 13%, whereas the share of the US dollar amounts to 68% and that of the Japanese yen to 5%. This share of the euro is comparable with the share which the euro legacy currencies reached prior to the launch of the single currency. Part of the reason for the high dollar share is - in addition to its \""traditionally\"" strong status - the relative magnitude of the euro area reserves, where the dollar is a natural investment currency.  All in all, on the basis of the facts it can be summarised that:      the euro is, without a shadow of doubt, an important global currency, and increasingly so;    the international role of the euro, strictly speaking, is growing only very slowly; and,    the role of the euro is particularly strong in countries and regions with important trade, historical or institutional links with the EU.      There are several ways in which this situation can be interpreted:  One the one hand, the fact that the euro has developed a significant international role in less than four years of existence can be considered as very positive feedback. Not only has it maintained the role inherited from the Deutsche Mark outside the euro area, but it has extended this role. This is remarkable given the fact that evolutions in the role of international currencies are typically very slow to materialise. From that point of view, more than the absolute level of use of the euro internationally, it is the dynamics of this use that is relevant.  However, a less optimistic interpretation is also possible. This consists in interpreting the difference between the respective roles of the US dollar and the euro as a symptom of the fact that the euro has yet to exhibit the features that would make it very attractive for potential users outside the euro area.  There are certainly elements of truth in both interpretations. In the subsequent part of my presentation, however, I will concentrate on the second possibility. Do not take this as a value judgement on the attractiveness of the euro. I should like to explain that the whole purpose of the exercise of investigation is to identify whether and how the effectiveness of our currency could be improved at the domestic level, and the analysis of the use of the euro internationally only serves to reveal areas where improvements could possibly be made.    3. A look at the domestic performance of the euro from an   international perspective   It is quite natural to conclude that the euro is failing to fully satisfy some of the requirements of international users, as discussed earlier. The last part of my presentation concentrates on separating the elements of the success and the areas to be developed in the domestic euro area.   Price stability   The first element is the adequacy of the euro as a unit of account and as a store of value. As concluded earlier, the attractiveness of a currency in this regard very much depends on the credibility attached to the maintenance of price stability in its domestic area.  Price stability is the basic building block in the current monetary policy philosophy globally and it is the unambiguous primary goal for the ECB or the Eurosystem in its decision-making. There can be little doubt that on that issue the euro can comfortably stand comparison with any other currency in the world. A solid basis for that is provided not only by the particular framework for monetary policy in the euro area, which is based on the full independence of the European Central Bank and the unequivocal character of its primary objective to maintain price stability, but also by the \""track record\"" of the ECB after almost four years of setting the single monetary policy.  I believe that all of this is widely acclaimed. And all of this is very firmly based on the well founded political perception, which arose after the frustrating instabilities of the 1970s and the 1980s, that the contribution of monetary policy to high growth and employment is necessarily and essentially linked to medium-term price stability.   The need for further financial market integration   The level of attractiveness of the euro as a medium of exchange derives directly from the level of development, effectiveness and soundness of the financial markets, including payment and securities settlement systems, as discussed earlier.  Here, the diagnosis is mixed. On the positive side, financial markets have experienced spectacular development since the introduction of the euro, as illustrated by the development of corporate bond markets for instance. In some segments, the euro-denominated markets have even achieved a degree of sophistication and development that now places them among the top-ranking global markets. As an illustration of this statement we can take the particular case of the overnight interest rate swap market, indexed on the overnight rate reference index, the EONIA. This is the most active and liquid market of its kind in the world.  A similar element of satisfaction is to be found on the side of large-value payment systems. In particular this regards the payment system operated by the Eurosystem, TARGET, which made it possible to create a euro area-wide money market immediately after the start of the single monetary policy. As you know, we have recently taken a strategic decision to ensure that TARGET will continue to be enhanced, with a view to better meeting its customers' needs, to guarantee the cost efficiency of the system and also to prepare for the EU enlargement process. The euro benefits - and will continue to benefit - in the wholesale market from a payment infrastructure that comfortably stands comparison with any other in the world.  This being said, there are other segments where the euro area has not yet reached a level of development and sophistication to put it on a par with the most developed markets in the world, primarily the US dollar. At the short end of the market, examples are the repo and commercial paper markets. While these market segments have been developing rather quickly over the past few years, they remain short of the size, depth and liquidity that could be considered possible in the longer term, both in absolute terms and in relation to the markets of the other two major currencies. Similarly, at the long end of the market, the capital market, there is still a long way to go, in spite of very positive developments in the government bond market. The equity markets in particular are still quite segmented and the corporate bond market still very underdeveloped in general.  The shortcomings of the segmentation of the euro area financial markets have been clearly recognised by the EU authorities. Indeed, progress towards integration requires a coherent and consistent implementation of policies aimed at achieving this goal.  However, integration also necessitates the active involvement of market participants, not only through the natural expression of market forces through competition, but also through co-ordination. The case of the aforementioned euro overnight interest rate swap market is a good illustration of that. This market relies on the definition of a reference index, the EONIA, that would not appear spontaneously as the outcome of a competition process but that could not be exogenously created by a public authority, either. It was a success after being made the subject of a co-ordinated agreement between private participants.  I do not think it is superfluous to recall here - in front of the representatives of the financial community that you are or are striving to become - the desirability of exploring every possible solution likely to facilitate and further the integration process for the financial system in Europe . Only when this process is completed across the euro area will the benefits of the single currency be reaped in full. I am sorry to say that we still see plenty of support within the euro area for protecting the old national markets and market structures from wider competition. This is very much reflected in the lack of harmonisation of national legislation, regulation and market practices and is thus hampering the integration of the financial markets.  The efficiency and stability of political decision-making   The question of the perception of the political efficiency and stability of the euro area is a complex one. The euro area is not the currency area of a single nation state, but that of the 12 states forming a solid economic but, so far, only partially political union within the EU. In addition, the boundaries of the euro area are not yet stable, since it is the eventual vocation of the euro to serve all the other current and future Member States of the EU, in addition to the current 12 participating countries.  One should not, however, underestimate the underlying strength and stability of the political entity served by the euro. For Europeans of my generation, who were born in a time of war and lived most of their life under the threat of the Cold War, the contribution of the EU to peace, prosperity and political stability in Europe is a concrete reality. The euro is tangible evidence of this reality.  There is no doubt, however, that the perception of the underlying political stability of the EU could benefit from more efficient political decision-making. The outcome of the Convention on the future of Europe , which recently released a first preliminary draft of a Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe , is in this sense very important. If it succeeds in its task, the Convention will help to complement the existing economic constitution with an effective and transparent political structure and processes.  The need for consistent and sustainable economic policies   The perception of the euro as a store of value also depends, of course, on the ability of policy-makers to implement consistent and sustainable economic policies. There is no doubt in this context that the attractiveness and effectiveness of the currency would benefit from the improvement, and especially the simplification, of the decision-making process in the EU. It is also important for there to be a simple and enforceable institutional framework for economic policy co-ordination between the euro area Member States.  Such a framework exists in the case of fiscal policy on the basis of the Stability and Growth Pact. By ensuring sustainable public finances and by providing enough flexibility for the full operation of the automatic stabilisers, the Stability and Growth Pact is essential for the macroeconomic stability of the euro area and for sustainable growth and employment. In this way, it increases the attractiveness of the euro area for foreign capital and thus also indirectly supports growth and employment.   Productivity and the need for structural reforms   As discussed earlier, to encourage capital inflows into the euro area investors must be offered good prospects for a positive return on their investments. A major factor here is, of course, the level of productivity and competitiveness of the euro area economy relative to other economies.  There is considerable interplay between this particular element and all the others I have listed. For instance, efficient and well-integrated markets are conducive to a better allocation of capital, which in turn raises economic potential and returns on investment. But it is clear that there is also a need for microeconomic reforms in the area of product and labour market regulation and social security systems, as well as a need for deeper changes in attitudes like entrepreneurial spirit. Sustained productivity differentials between the euro area and the United States are seen to be one of the main reasons for the lower relative performance of the euro as an investment vehicle.  We need to ask whether structural reforms to increase flexibility in the labour markets, had they been implemented earlier across the euro area, could have made the euro area economy both more productive generally and more resilient to the recent global economic downturn in particular.  We need to ask to what extent medium-term economic prospects in the euro area are being threatened by the timidity of the reforms of pension systems in several euro area countries. The current context of an ageing population is obviously putting the current social security arrangements at risk and is threatening the income developments and income expectations of the current wage earners.    Concluding remark   In a rather lengthy way I have discussed the different features that combine to make an international currency. As a concluding remark, I would like to stress that the unambiguous primary goal of the euro and the monetary policies connected to it form a solid basis and a favourable environment for sustainable and stable growth, for the well-being of the euro area citizens and thus for the international currency.  Price stability is a basic building block for a healthy economy and a competitive currency, but it is not sufficient on its own. All the Member States that have adopted the euro urgently need to reinforce their efforts to create truly integrated, efficient and flexible markets in all fields. They also need to enhance mutual co-ordination and co-operation across the board inside the EMU.       [1] Jevons, William Stanley (1875), \""Money and the Mechanism of Exchange\"", D.

"15","\""The European Monetary Union in a globalised world\""   Speech by Professor Otmar Issing Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank at Second Vienna Globalization Symposium Institut für den Donauraum und Mitteleuropa Wirtschaftskammer Österreich Wien, 11. Mai 2001       1. Introduction     The role of the European Monetary Union (EMU) in an increasingly globalised world is a rather challenging topic for many reasons but not least because it requires also addressing another important element of international integration, namely \""regionalisation\"". After all, the creation of the euro area is not only tied in with the wider process of globalisation but is also part and parcel of the European regional integration process.  Some see European integration as a defensive reaction to globalisation, with the European Union (EU) as a fortress attempting to shut out the challenges and uncertainties of globalisation. In my view, this reasoning is extremely dangerous. First, the \""fortress Europe hypothesis\"" fails to take into account that the process of European integration started more than half a century ago, i.e. well before the phenomenon of globalisation became apparent. Second, its aims go well beyond the realm of economics, since it is also politically motivated. Third, even large economic entities such as the euro area and the EU can not prosper in the long run if they become inward-looking and close their doors to the rest of the world. It is therefore much more useful to emphasise the positive links between European integration and globalisation. Economic integration will enhance growth and competition in the euro area, which in turn will result in more trade and greater capital flows. Furthermore, fast-growing and competitive economies are likely to be less responsive to possible calls for protectionism. In short, progress on regional integration can support rather than impede the globalisation process, to the advantage of all concerned.  I would like to begin this speech by taking a \""regional\"" perspective, presenting to you some of the key features of EMU: first, focusing on the euro area itself and, second, on the European Central Bank. After that, I will take a look at the role of the euro as an international currency and I will finish my remarks by reviewing some of the current challenges for EMU. More specifically, I will sketch what the euro area can do for the outside world and the policy reforms that are still needed in order to ensure a high level of sustainable growth.       2. The euro area     Measured in terms of population, the euro area is one of the largest economic entities in the world, with a total of around 302 million inhabitants. By comparison, the populations of the United States and Japan are 272 million and 127 million, respectively.  The GDP of the euro area, including Greece, was just below EUR 6.250 billion in 1999. This is equivalent to 16.2% of world GDP: 5.7 percentage points less than the share of the United States but more than twice the share of Japan.  Given that trade between the individual euro area Member States is no longer recorded as international trade, at least from the point of view of the euro area, its openness vis-à-vis the rest of the world appears to be limited. Whereas the average ratio of goods exports to GDP for the individual euro area countries was around 35%, the share of euro area goods exports to GDP (adjusted for intra-euro area trade) was only about 12.9% in 1999. Nevertheless, the euro are is still more open than the world's other two major economies. In 1999 euro area exports of goods and services made up 18.9% of world exports, compared with 15.2% for the United States and 9.1% for Japan.  EMU is also having dynamic effects and is acting as a catalyst for the further integration of the euro area economy. This is particularly obvious in the case of euro area financial markets. Even in the run-up to EMU, there was a marked decline in financial transaction costs. Since the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999 this decline has accelerated.. Furthermore, trading activity has expanded, particularly in segments such as the private bond markets. As a result, it is easier for market participants to carry out large transactions within a short period of time and with lower costs. Hence, not only bid-ask spreads but also other indicators point towards an increase in the depth and liquidity of euro area financial markets.  Progress on financial market integration is also apparent in recent structural developments in stock markets. In 1999 and 2000, a vast array of initiatives were launched by stock exchanges with a view to forming alliances or merging activities. These initiatives, also involving exchanges located in non-euro area countries, notably the United Kingdom and the United States, reflect increasing financial market integration as well as \""technological\"" factors such as the increased potential for economies of scope and scale resulting from new information and communication technologies (ICT).       3. The European Central Bank     Let me now turn to the euro and the European Central Bank itself, its mandate and its strategy. Given the importance of credibility for central banking it is crucial for the success of EMU that the Treaty establishing the European Community - which I will refer to as the \""Treaty\"" - provides a sound institutional framework for an effective monetary policy.  It is not my intention to review the provisions of the Treaty in any detail, but it is worth recalling that the Treaty clearly establishes the maintenance of price stability in the euro area - i.e. the internal stability of the euro - as the primary objective for the single monetary policy. This takes into account that the best contribution that the ECB can make to the economic and social wellbeing of the euro area is to focus on maintaining price stability. Without prejudice to its primary objective, the single monetary policy shall also support the general economic policies of the European Community. However, the means and the responsibility for ensuring other objectives, such as a high level of employment and output growth, lie primarily at the national level and, to some extent, at the level of EU institutions. The allocation of tasks and objectives to different policy-makers in the euro area is thus very clear, which in turn ensures efficiency, transparency and accountability in economic governance.  Furthermore, the Treaty ensures the independence of the ECB. In this way, potential political pressures must be resisted and European citizens can be assured that the ECB will take a long-term, euro area-wide perspective in pursuing its mandate of maintaining price stability.  The design of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB was guided by the recognition that monetary policy will always have to cope with a changing and imperfectly known world. In addition, it had to be borne in mind that the creation of EMU and the establishment of the ECB marked a historical discontinuity, with potentially profound implications for economic behaviour and measured structural relationships.  In these circumstances, the Governing Council of the ECB chose to announce a quantitative definition of price stability and to equip itself with an internally consistent and at the same time comprehensive and suitably flexible approach to policy analysis.  The definition of price stability as \""a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices of below 2%\"", along with the emphasis on the medium term, is designed to enhance clarity, to anchor expectations and to provide a yardstick against which the new independent institution can be held accountable.  Likewise, our two-pillar monetary policy strategy is intended to guarantee that no piece of evidence relevant to monetary policy decision-making is excluded from the Governing Council's information set. The prominent role assigned to money, as the first pillar of our strategy, ensures that monetary developments receive the attention that they deserve, given the monetary nature of inflation beyond the short-term horizon. The second pillar of the strategy ensures that other ways of analysing the outlook for inflation, such as the investigation of the interplay between supply and demand and cost-push dynamics, are also incorporated into the policy process. Together, the two pillars ensure that information and analysis produced on the basis of one methodological perspective are always cross-checked against information and analysis produced on the basis of the other.  Looking back over the first two and a half years of the ECB, it is fair to say that the comprehensive analytical framework of the ECB's monetary policy strategy has served our decision-making process well. Furthermore, its analytical framework has provided the basis for a thorough explanation of monetary policy decisions to the general public.  Critical observers may point towards the fact that the annual rate of change in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area has been above 2% for some time now. In 2000 HICP inflation stood on average at 2.3%, with the highest monthly rate being recorded in November (2.9%). In March 2001 HICP inflation stood at 2.6%.  However, monetary policy has to have a medium-term perspective and cannot guarantee that the rate of change of the HICP is below 2% at all times. Short-term volatility of prices cannot be controlled and monetary policy should not try to correct it. In fact, the unexpected peak in HICP inflation in 2000 resulted mainly from external price pressures, in particular developments in oil prices and the exchange rate of the euro. The increase in energy prices, for example, contributed on average more than 1 percentage point to overall inflation in 2000 and our main concern was that this should not lead to second-round effects in the domestic economy. Fortunately, this has generally been avoided so far. In contrast to external developments, domestic costs, such as unit labour costs, generally remained subdued in 2000.  At the current juncture upward risks to price stability have diminished somewhat compared with the situation a few months ago, but they have not disappeared. Recent downward revisions of forecasts for world growth indicate that the external environment has become less favourable, although such forecasts are surrounded by considerable uncertainty. Some indirect effects of past rises in oil prices and the past depreciation of the euro on HICP inflation are likely to continue for another couple of months, but they should gradually diminish over time. Beyond the short term, the abatement of domestic upward pressure on HICP inflation remains conditional on the continuation of wage moderation.       4. The euro as an international currency     Having adopted a more \""regional\"" perspective for the last couple of minutes, I would now like to turn your attention to a more \""global\"" aspect of EMU, namely the international role of the euro.  Given the weight of the euro area in the world economy and the legacy of the former national currencies which have been replaced by the euro, it is no surprise that the euro is the second most widely used currency after the US dollar.  As regards the private use of the euro, recent trends show that it has been used extensively as a financing and instrument currency. At the end of 2000 the share of the euro in the overall stock of \""truly international\"" debt securities (i.e. debt securities issued in a currency different from that of the country in which the borrower resides) reached 26%. This share is 7 percentage points higher than the combined shares of the former national currencies of the euro area countries at the end of 1998 (at constant exchange rates). Furthermore, the share of the euro in international bank assets has also increased substantially over the last two years.  Movement in other areas has been less rapid. The share of the euro in settling/invoicing international trade, for example, is currently estimated to be only around 15% to 17% of total international trade. This is significantly below the euro area's proportion of world trade in goods and services. By contrast, the value of international trade settled in US dollars is nearly four times as high as that of US exports. Furthermore, on a global level the euro does not yet seem to be playing an important role as a vehicle currency in the foreign exchange markets (i.e. a currency that can be used as a means of exchanging two other currencies) or as a pricing and quotation currency.  Future developments with regard to the private international use of the euro are likely to be heavily influenced by two main factors - size and risk. With regard to the size factor, a broad, deep and liquid euro area capital market may lead to greater use of the euro through lower transaction costs. This may, in turn, facilitate the development of the euro as a vehicle currency for trade and commodity pricing. In addition, if international investors and issuers consider the euro to be a stable currency, they will hold euro assets to minimise risk in their internationally diversified portfolios. Only if investors outside the euro area are confident that their purchasing power will be preserved over time will they engage in euro-denominated financial activities. Besides price stability, the current and expected growth performance of the euro area economy is an additional factor behind the attractiveness of the euro. Sustained non-inflationary growth in the euro area economy is thus also likely to have beneficial effects on market expectations and encourage the international use of the euro.  Looking at official international uses, the euro is the second most widely used official reserve currency after the US dollar. The gap between the two currencies, however, is wide. According to the latest available data, at the end of 1999 the euro accounted for around 13% of the world's official foreign currency holdings compared with a US dollar share of around 70%.  As an anchor currency, the euro plays a role in the exchange rate regime of more than 50 countries outside the euro area. The solutions adopted by these countries range from very close or even full links to the euro, such as the formal entitlement to use the euro as legal tender, to looser types of anchoring, such as peg arrangements and crawling fluctuation bands.  It will be no surprise to you to hear that developments in the EU accession countries are of particular importance for the ECB. After all, these countries are expected to join the EU in a few years' time. Furthermore, it is worth recalling that the proper adoption of the acquis communautaire also includes the provisions relating to Economic and Monetary Union. The central banks of the current candidate countries will therefore also become candidates for the adoption of the euro at a later point in time.  This is reflected in the fact that the existing close links between the euro area and the accession countries have further intensified. To give just two examples, the euro has inherited from the Deutsche Mark the role of vehicle currency for exchanging other European currencies in accession countries. Furthermore, it is worth pointing out that the share of the euro in the reserves of EU accession countries has increased somewhat since 1999 and now actually exceeds the share of the US dollar.  With regard to candidate countries' monetary policy strategies, I find it rather encouraging that they are, in most cases, increasingly similar to that of the ECB. Centred on price stability, the conduct of monetary policy is being built more and more around the use of indirect and market-based instruments to control liquidity conditions in the banking system. Accession countries will need to further advance the process of bringing down inflation rates in the years to come. At the same time, they should not delay the much-needed relative price adjustments within the economy which form part of the real convergence process.  As for exchange rate regimes in the period prior to accession to the EU, there are no formal requirements. Each country remains responsible for its chosen exchange rate regime, and a plurality of approaches seems feasible. Such a variety could also be observed with respect to existing Member States prior to their entry into the EU. In brief, during this phase the consistency of economic policies and their appropriateness for the economic situation in individual countries appear to be more important than the specific choice of an exchange rate regime.  By way of a conclusion to this brief overview of the international role of the euro, I would like to emphasise that future developments in this field will first and foremost be the outcome of a market-driven process. The Eurosystem is neither promoting nor hindering the internationalisation of the euro. This neutral stance should not, however, be interpreted as implying that a possible further internationalisation of the euro would be irrelevant to policy. Indeed, there are good reasons why the Eurosystem will continue to monitor these developments closely. A further increase in the international use of the euro might, for example, have an impact on both the transmission mechanism of monetary policy within the euro area and the information content of indicators under the monetary policy strategy. However, the international use of the euro is not expected to have any effect on the ability of the Eurosystem to maintain price stability, in particular because the Eurosystem's monetary policy strategy is well suited to coping with uncertainty and to arrive at a robust assessment of the monetary policy stance.       5. The euro area in a globalised world     I would like to finish my deliberations by addressing two questions. First, adopting an international perspective, what is the appropriate international role of the euro area for the rest of the world? Second, taking an inward-looking perspective, what domestic policy reforms are needed in the euro area in order to ensure a higher level of sustainable growth and thereby contribute to the growth of the world economy?  Looking at the first question, the recent US slowdown has often raised the question as to who might take over from the United States as the \""global growth engine\""? Given the current state of the Japanese economy, most observers have of course earmarked the euro area for that role. However, I would contend that the question itself is totally misleading. Indeed, US economic policy has, in my view, always been conducted, and rightly so, with a clear focus on domestic objectives. It is important to note in this regard that the periods of sustainable non-inflationary growth experienced in the United States have in fact coincided with those periods when the United States was making a significant contribution to both growth and stability the world over.  In principle, the same logic should also hold for the euro area. As pointed out before, the euro area is the second largest economic area in the world. Furthermore, relative to its GDP it is the most open of the three large economies in terms of trade in goods and services. Economic developments in the euro area are therefore obviously of considerable importance for developments and prospects elsewhere. However, the best contribution which a large economy such as the euro area can make to supporting sustainable non-inflationary growth in the world economy is to ensure macroeconomic stability \""at home\"", which in turn is fully consistent with the mandate of the ECB. Unduly ambitious attempts by the euro area to take over the role of \""international growth engine\"" - however well-intentioned they might be - would risk ending in unsustainable euro area growth and, thereby, in an anything but optimal contribution to stability and growth at the global level.  That said, I very much hope that the already substantial contribution of the euro area to global economic growth can increase even further. The extent to which this will be possible depends on the increase in the euro area's growth potential, which in turn is closely linked with ongoing efforts to stipulate further structural reforms in the euro area's goods, labour and financial markets.  Over the last few years a number of structural reforms have already taken place, but in most countries the current state of affairs is still far from satisfactory. Let me give you a few examples of this, starting with labour markets. Although the euro area unemployment rate has fallen in recent years, it remains significantly higher than in the world's other large economies. In February 2001 euro area unemployment stood at 8.7% compared with 4.2% in the United States and 4.7% in Japan. Furthermore, the euro area labour force participation rate of 67.3% in 1999 was considerably lower than the participation rate in the United States (77.2%) or Japan (72.4%). At the same time there are increasing indications of labour market bottlenecks in the euro area, especially in particular countries and regions and for particular types of jobs. Therefore labour market reforms in the euro area need to focus on further changes in the tax and benefits systems, with a view to increasing incentives to work. Furthermore, efforts along these lines, though welcome in themselves, need to be complemented by reforms that increase the flexibility of labour markets.  As I have already outlined, the integration of euro area financial markets has progressed rapidly over the last two years. However, there are also areas where the pace of integration has been slower, for example in the repo market, where progress is being delayed by a combination of technical factors, such as market infrastructure and remaining differences in the tax regimes applicable to repo transactions. Resolving such problems requires a clear political will to proceed with financial market integration in the euro area and, in fact, in the EU as a whole. The same holds for the implementation of the recommendations of the \""Committee of Wise Men\"" chaired by Baron Alexandre Lamfalussy on the regulation of European securities markets. Once put into force, these recommendations should also provide further impetus for euro area financial market integration.  In the long run further improvements in the efficiency of euro area financial markets will result in a better allocation of financial resources, which, in turn, will contribute to a general increase in economic welfare. In this context it would be well worth taking up the suggestion of the Committee of Wise Men to prepare a report on the benefits of financial market integration. Such a report could be instrumental in increasing public awareness of the importance of further progress in this area.  Turning to the involvement of the state in the economy, the euro area general government sector makes up a substantially larger share of output than in the United States and Japan. In 1999, euro area government expenditure amounted to 49% of the euro area's GDP. This is in stark contrast with the relative size of the public sectors in the United States and Japan, where general government expenditures accounted for less than 32% and 40% of GDP respectively. The difference is mainly a result of high public employment and overly generous state aid in the euro area. Very high taxes are required to finance these activities, which in turn result in considerable disincentives to work, save and invest. The euro area figure thus clearly suggests that there is significant scope for a reduction of public involvement in the euro area economy.  During the last couple of years network industry reforms in telecommunications, electricity and gas have proceeded relatively rapidly in the euro area: the ECB has recently published a study of the effects of regulatory reforms in these sectors. The results show that reforms that succeed in increasing competition in previously sheltered network industries have considerable general economic benefits. They are likely to result in permanently lower price levels within the network industries themselves and to have a temporary downward effect on inflation in the economy as a whole. In addition, these regulatory reforms have the potential to raise productivity.  Slow progress in other structural policy areas shows that the policy-makers in this field, in particular the Member States, should be continuously encouraged to proceed with their reform efforts. After all, a thorough and speedy implementation of such reforms will not only increase the growth potential of the euro area but it is also important for ensuring the international competitiveness of the euro area.       6. Challenges    This last point brings me back to the start of my speech, namely the need for all economies, including very large ones such as the euro area, to remain outward-looking. It is reassuring to know that the euro area is today better placed than ever to cope with the challenges of international exposure, while at the same time reaping the benefits of globalisation. In order to do so three elements are needed. First, the dynamic effects of EMU will deepen the economic integration of the euro area. This in turn is likely to yield general economic benefits such as a more efficient allocation of resources within the euro area economy. Second, the ECB's stability-oriented single monetary policy provides stable framework conditions for economic agents. With regard to other macroeconomic policy areas, policy-makers at the national and to some extent the European level, have the same responsibility. Third, structural reforms in goods, capital and labour markets have to proceed in order to allow the euro area to better exploit its growth potential in the future. I am very optimistic about the first two of these elements. EMU is of course in place, economic integration appears to be making good progress, and the outlook for continued macroeconomic stability is good. With regard to the third element the uncertainties are somewhat greater, but on balance they still justify a fair degree of optimism. In short, I am confident that the euro area economy is likely to experience sustained non-inflationary growth in the future, thereby contributing to growth and economic stability on a global scale.",1
"16","\""The Eurosystem and the integration of European financial markets\"", 50th Anniversary of ACI – The Financial Markets Association   Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, Paris, 28 October 2005      1. Introduction     Ladies and Gentlemen, I accepted with pleasure the invitation to speak to you today on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of ACI – The Financial Markets Association.  First of all, I would like to congratulate your association – fifty years is an impressive length of time. The anniversary prompts us to look back in time. When I think back to the 1950s, the year 1952 immediately comes to mind. It was the year when the European Union started out as the European Coal and Steel Community. As we know, the idea at that time was to better preserve peace by bringing together under a common European roof, with rules that were binding for all participating countries, those resources that had been decisive for the conduct of wars – coal and steel.  Encouraged by their success, the European countries decided to also integrate other sectors of their economies in order to form a common market. In the course of time, other countries joined the European Union – as it has been called since the Maastricht Treaty of 1992 – encompassing today 25 countries.  Key milestones have been successfully reached during these years. As President of the ECB, let me in particular highlight the fact that the euro indeed acted as a strong catalyst for the further integration of European financial markets. On the side of the ACI, allow me to mention that you founded in 1999, at the time of the launch of the euro, the Euribor ACI, which has since then led several initiatives – and I will later address some of them – that foster financial integration in Europe and in particular in the euro area.  This is actually the topic I would like to address today: European financial integration.  I have organised my remarks along the following main lines. I will first explain the Eurosystem’s interest in European financial integration. Then I will mention different kinds of activity conducted by the Eurosystem that contribute to enhancing European financial integration. I will today focus on a particular financial market, namely the money market, and on a particular kind of Eurosystem activity, namely our possible role to act as a catalyst for private-sector activities to foster the integration of European financial markets. Such initiatives involve close collaboration with market participants, among them the ACI and the Euribor ACI.       2. The Eurosystem’s interest in European financial integration    The Eurosystem’s interest in European financial integration is founded on three basic reasons. First, the financial system is used for the conduct of monetary policy in the euro area, which is the basic task assigned to the Eurosystem under the Treaty establishing the European Community (“the Treaty”).[1] A well-integrated financial system enhances the smooth and effective transmission of monetary policy impulses throughout the euro area. Second, financial integration has implications for the Eurosystem’s task of safeguarding financial stability in the euro area and the EU, as laid down in the Treaty.[2] The pursuit of financial integration can have very beneficial effects on financial stability as more integrated financial markets could provide the necessary conditions for the smoother absorption of financial shocks. It may also help financial institutions to better manage and diversify their risks and realise economies of scale, which may, in turn, lead to greater efficiency. At the same time, it is necessary to closely monitor the profound changes in the nature of financial stability challenges due to the structural transformation of the financial system, including intensified cross-border links.  Third, financial integration can generally help to promote the development of financial markets, institutions and infrastructures, thereby helping to support economic activity and to raise the potential for economic growth. According to the Treaty, the Eurosystem shall “without prejudice to the objective of price stability, […] support the general economic policies in the Community”.[3] The Eurosystem is fully committed to supporting the general economic policies of the Community, with a view to contributing to the achievement of its objectives. This includes financial integration, which is a priority Community objective. I recall in this respect the findings of a recent study that quantified the macro-economic impact of the integration of European bond and equity markets.[4] The study found that such financial integration would result in additional EU GDP growth of around 1% - i.e. around EUR 100 billion – over a ten-year period.  On a more general note, I would like to recall another principle laid down in the Treaty that states that the Eurosystem “shall act in accordance with the principle of an open market economy with free competition, favouring an efficient allocation of resources”.[5] This also determines the Eurosystem’s view that financial integration is first and foremost a market-driven process. In addition to this, the Eurosystem sees it as a basic task of public authorities to create a framework conducive to fostering financial integration. If the opportunities thus created have been exploited by market forces, true financial integration will have been achieved and its benefits can be reaped.      3. The Eurosystem’s contribution to fostering European financial integration    As we see it, the basic task of public authorities with regard to the process of financial integration is to create a framework whereby, generally speaking, all potential market participants in a given financial instruments or services market are subject to a single set of rules when they decide to deal with those financial instruments or services, have equal access to this set of financial instruments or services and are treated equally when they operate in the market.  The Eurosystem generally distinguishes between four types of activity through which it contributes to fostering financial integration.  First, we provide central banking services that are conducive to European financial integration. An example of this is the TARGET system that we run, which today handles around 90% of large-value euro payment traffic. TARGET is one of the two largest wholesale payment systems in the world, the other being Fedwire in the United States. TARGET2 – the launch of the single shared platform is planned for November 2007[6] – will foster financial integration even more. TARGET2 will enable the provision of a harmonised level of services across Europe, supported by a single technical platform and a single price structure for domestic and cross-border payments, and it will have new functionalities for banks to better integrate their euro liquidity management. Second, we give advice on shaping the legislative and regulatory framework for the financial system. As an example, I would like to mention the Eurosystem’s contribution to the European Commission’s consultation on the priorities for financial services policy over the next five years.[7] In this contribution, the Eurosystem expresses its support to the key policy orientations of the Green Paper which focuses on the consolidation and consistent implementation of the legislative framework for financial services to be achieved by exploiting the potential of the existing institutional set-up and by a profound assessment – both ex ante and ex post – of new legislative initiatives. The Eurosystem also supports the strands of action suggested by the Commission in the area of financial regulation and supervision, in particular the importance attached to the objective of rationalising the existing regulatory framework and the pursuit of supervisory convergence.  Third, we try to enhance knowledge and raise awareness of the state of and need for European financial integration, and we measure the progress made towards its achievement.  And fourth, we can act as a catalyst for private-sector activities by facilitating collective action and assisting with possible coordination problems.  I would like to concentrate more particularly on these last two kinds of activity, namely measuring the state of financial integration and acting as a catalyst for private-sector activities.       4. The integration of European financial markets and selected examples of fostering it    The basic starting point for any possible action is to first assess the state of affairs in order to gather the evidence upon which the decision to undertake a certain activity can be based. For a financial instrument or financial service, a price normally exists, so one can use quantitative indicators, based on the law of one price, to measure the degree of integration. In this respect, let me draw your attention to the ECB’s report on “Indicators of financial integration in the euro area” that was published at the end of last month.[8]  This report provides an assessment of the degree of financial integration in the main segments of the euro area financial market, covering the money market, the government and corporate bond markets, the equity market and banking markets. I should also like to point out that while this first report, which covers financial and banking markets, already focuses on important dimensions of the financial system, the coverage of the indicators will be further developed; in particular, it is envisaged to add indicators of the underlying factors of integration related to financial institutions and market infrastructures. The ECB report provides, on the basis of 20 quantitative indicators, an overall assessment of the degree of financial integration in the main financial market segments. It is shown that the degree of integration differs from market segment to market segment, with integration being more advanced in those market segments that are closer to the single monetary policy. Today, I will indeed concentrate on the most integrated market, namely the money market, and I would like to refer you to the report for our assessment of the other financial markets.  As regards the money market, the various indicators presented in the ECB report measure financial integration based on the dispersion of lending rates – namely overnight rates, unsecured lending rates and repo rates – offered by banks in euro area countries, with the data referring to actual transactions or rates offered by EONIA, EURIBOR and EUREPO panel banks.  Also the different segments of the money market show different degrees of integration.  The unsecured interbank market has, since shortly after the introduction of the euro, been integrated to a nearly perfect extent. In fact, our indicators display a euro area cross-country standard deviation for the overnight maturity of around 3 basis points shortly after the start of 1999 and only around one basis point by today. As a comparison to these impressive figures, just recall that one year before the start of monetary union, in January 1998, the cross-country standard deviation of the average overnight lending rates among euro area countries still stood at more than 130 basis points.  As a first example of the Eurosystem’s contributions to fostering financial integration by acting as a catalyst for private-sector activities, I would like to mention the ECB’s calculation and publication of the EONIA rate. The technical definition and the procedures for the calculation of the EONIA rate were defined by market participants through a series of market conventions. The EONIA rate is a concrete example how market participants play an important role in fostering financial integration through the adoption of market conventions, facilitated by the ECB acting as a catalyst. A consistent picture of a highly integrated unsecured money market is also painted by the indicators for the maturities longer than overnight. Both the cross-country standard deviation of EURIBOR lending rates among euro area countries for the one-month and for the 12-month maturity stood even below one basis point shortly after the introduction of the euro and remained stable thereafter. This compares with the respective values in January 1998, i.e. one year before the start of monetary union, of more than 100 basis points for the one-month rates and of around 50 basis points for the 12-month rates.  The growing repo market is still somewhat less integrated than the unsecured segment, but integration is progressing. The creation of the EUREPO index – the benchmark for secured money market transactions in the euro area – in 2002 was an important market initiative to further promote the integration of the repo market. Our indicators for the integration of the repo market reveal that the euro area cross-country standard deviation of the one-month EUREPO rates was around, and normally below, one basis point and today stands at around 0.5 basis point. The indicator for the 12-month EUREPO rates shows larger movements, in part reflecting the lower liquidity of this market. Still, with a standard deviation always below 2.5 basis points, and today standing at around 1.5 basis points, the indicators suggest that there is a relatively high degree of integration also in the euro area repo market.  The major role of the euro in enhancing financial market integration is also visible in the interest rate derivatives markets. The total of euro interest rate OTC derivatives contracts reaches a daily turnover of around EUR 380 billion, thereby being larger than the US dollar segment, with a daily turnover of around EUR 290 billion.[9] A particularly important part of this is the euro interest rate swap market, with a daily turnover of almost EUR 250 billion. It is the largest interest rate swap market in the world, i.e. also larger than the equivalent US dollar segment that has a daily turnover of around EUR 160 billion.[10] Let me in this respect also highlight the success of the euro overnight index swap market, where contracts are exchanged in which one party pays a fixed rate of interest for the duration of the contract, while the other party pays an average of the overnight EONIA rate realised over the period. The launch, conducted jointly by Euribor FBE (European Banking Federation) and Euribor ACI, of the EONIA Swap Index in June this year is evidence of both the importance and the further potential of this market segment. I now turn to the least integrated money market segment, namely the one for short-term securities. Compared with the equivalent US commercial paper market, which has an outstanding amount of around EUR 1.3 trillion, the aggregate size of the commercial paper and certificates of deposit markets in Europe is around EUR 0.8 trillion.[11] In addition, while the US market is integrated, the short-term securities markets in Europe continue to be segmented, with de facto several markets based in several market places. Issuers and investors in the European short-term paper markets are therefore confronted with reduced depth and liquidity, and they have less diversification opportunities than in the US. The Short-Term European Paper (STEP) initiative, which was set up and is being led by ACI – The Financial Markets Association, aims to overcome such fragmentation and to promote the development of a pan-European short-term paper market. STEP specifically aims to promote the convergence of the standards and practices prevailing in the European short-term securities markets through market players’ voluntary compliance with the standards set out in the STEP Market Convention, which covers aspects like information disclosure, documentation, settlement, and the provision of data for the production of STEP statistics. Since May this year, the European Banking Federation has been very fruitfully supporting the ACI in the completion of the preparatory work. Moreover, the European Banking Federation will directly contribute to the functioning of the STEP market, once in operation.  The promoters are at present finalising the STEP convention and expect to see the first STEP-labelled programme in early 2006. As with the example of the ECB calculating and publishing the EONIA rate, which I mentioned earlier, the ECB has supported the STEP initiative since its inception by acting as a catalyst for private-sector activities. Back in 2001, the first discussions on STEP took place at the meetings of the ECB Money Market Contact Group. In 2002, the ECB hosted on its website the ACI’s public consultation on the first STEP report. And, finally, ECB staff have contributed to the work of the Euribor ACI STEP Task Force since its creation. The Eurosystem will also provide operational support to the functioning of the STEP market. In July 2004, the Governing Council of the ECB discussed the recommendations addressed to the European System of Central Banks in the final report of the Euribor ACI STEP Task Force. The Governing Council welcomed the STEP initiative and took a favourable attitude towards its aim to ease the convergence of standards and to foster the integration of the fragmented European short-term paper markets through a market-led initiative. Specifically, the Governing Council decided to support, in principle, the activities pertaining to the introduction of a STEP label, which will acknowledge the adoption of the STEP standards, for the first two years after its launch. The STEP Secretariat, which will be created and managed by the European Banking Federation, will perform the STEP labelling with the support of the Eurosystem and, in particular, of several of its national central banks. Such a technical contribution to the labelling process would, however, not lead to a national central bank taking any action, such as the prohibition or suspension of issuance, in the event of non-compliance by an issuer with the convention’s requirements. In such a case, the only consequence would be that the STEP Secretariat would withdraw the STEP label from the issuance programme in question.  Moreover, the Governing Council of the ECB decided, subject to a final check regarding the efficiency of the collection process, to accept the request put forward in the Euribor ACI STEP Task Force report, to produce and publish STEP statistics on yields and volumes on an ongoing basis, which would foster integration and reduce issuers’ costs through greater market transparency. I have the pleasure to inform you today that the work of the ECB and the national central banks in this respect is well advanced. Just a few days ago, the Governing Council has approved the so-called efficiency check, i.e. the assessment of the costs and benefits related to the production of STEP statistics, and decided that the Eurosystem will indeed produce such statistics.  Now, after a long preparatory phase, the urgent priority is to complete the STEP Market Convention, which is the cornerstone of the whole project and the last step to be overcome to achieve its successful completion. I am confident that the promoters of the initiative, foremost the ACI, will find the necessary drive to overcome the last technical difficulties in the preparation of this document and will successfully launch STEP early next year. This will bring about the necessary integration and development in this market, surpassing the remaining current segmentation between the part of this market.  The success of the STEP initiative will also be proof that market-led initiatives are essential for the benefits of integrated financial markets in Europe to be reaped. Furthermore, it should show that self-regulation – to which the Eurosystem, like yourselves, attaches significant importance – complements and can even, in some respects, be a substitute for public regulation. Markets obviously do not function only on the basis of public regulation: they also need rules devised by the market players themselves, who know best which standards and business practices would lead to efficient outcomes. In view of the potential to realise economies of scale and scope inherent in an integrated European financial market, the private sector should accordingly contribute to establish such rules at the European level.  Market forces alone may not always be able to drive financial integration forward or towards an optimal outcome. In areas such as standard setting or the establishment of common infrastructures, the cooperation between private agents of the financial sector is as necessary as competition. Also, there is still a need for market participants to further develop the coordination of joint interests. Market associations, such as the ACI, have an important role to play in this respect.  The function of a catalyst can help coordination. A central bank can perform this role thanks to its acknowledged competence and objectivity, its direct participation in financial markets and its numerous contacts with market participants which ensue from its basic tasks. In fact, I consider the catalyst function of the ECB and the Eurosystem in fostering European financial integration to be a major responsibility at the current juncture.      5. Concluding remarks    Ladies and Gentlemen,  I would like to conclude my remarks by stressing that progress in European financial integration requires an effective interplay between market forces and action by public authorities. The ECB and the Eurosystem prefer a market-first approach in this process, with a significant role given to self-regulation. Examples like the STEP initiative show that the private sector can contribute substantially to the integration of the European financial system and that the Eurosystem supports such market-led initiatives.  While expressing my congratulations to ACI – The Financial Markets Association on its 50th anniversary, I would also like to encourage you all to take up the challenges that lie ahead of us. STEP-like initiatives should become a more widely used approach to fostering financial integration in Europe. A lot has been achieved, but just as much remains to be done.  Thank you very much for your attention.

"17","100 days of EMU: First experiences and further perspectives   Eugenio Domingo Solans Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank Speech delivered at the Hochschule für Bankwirtschaft/HfB Frankfurt am Main, 14 April 1999  INTRODUCTION  Allow me to begin by going back two and a half years, to 4 October 1996 to be exact, when I had the opportunity to address the members of the Hochschule für Bankwirtschaft at the diploma ceremony for graduates.  On that occasion, I referred to the process of European Monetary Union and to Spain's position on this issue. I should like to recall one paragraph of my speech:  \""Is it really a question of choosing between the number of countries joining the future European Monetary Union or its stability? Quite honestly, I do not think so. I do not mind admitting that if there were a dilemma about this, I should be in favour of stability. I think it would be better to construct the European Union more slowly and give priority to economic stability. But given the efforts the main European countries are making to converge, I am sure that a significant number of them will meet the convergence criteria and be able to join Monetary Union with full guarantees of stability. I am also sure that Spain will be one of them.\""  I still remember the smiles of most of those attending when I pronounced these last words, clearly reflecting scepticism.  I was convinced that the single currency, which was later named the euro, would be introduced. I was also convinced that Spain would be present among the countries joining this project. I could even accept back then the idea of a Spaniard as member of the Executive Board of the future European Central Bank (ECB). But what I could not predict, because my optimism has its limits, was that this Spaniard would be me.  The fact is that here I am now, pleased to be a citizen of Frankfurt, and to have the opportunity of visiting the Hochschule again, this important centre of Frankfurt. Thank you very much for inviting me.  Although we conventionally consider 100 days to be the minimum period of time necessary to form an opinion on something or somebody, we would all agree that this period is nothing in the lifetime of a currency. The Deutsche Mark has lasted fifty years. Several years went by before it could gain its reputation of stability. Something similar could be the case for the euro.  Nevertheless, if not a sound judgement, it is always possible to convey some first impressions after the first 100 days of the life of a new currency, and after almost one year of the life of the institution responsible for its regulation: the ECB.  In this first appraisal of the euro and the ECB, I shall mainly refer to the functional aspects related to monetary policy, after which I shall say a few words about other ESCB functions. I shall end my contribution with comments on some of the further perspectives of the euro and the ESCB, especially regarding institutional issues, as indicated in the second part of the title of my speech.   100 DAYS OF MONETARY POLICY  The monetary policy of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) formulated by the ECB and implemented by the national central banks (NCBs) is, without a doubt, a big success.  Speaking of monetary policy means speaking of three different elements, which together form the basic machinery, the correct functioning of which is the main responsibility of the ESCB. These three elements are the following: the objectives, the strategy and the instruments. Let us consider them separately.    The objectives   The objectives of the ECB were established in the Maastricht Treaty. According to Article 105 of the Treaty, \""the primary objective of the ESCB shall be to maintain price stability\"". Thus, stability is the main goal of the Eurosystem and it is, therefore, the main touchstone to assess its success or failure. The success of the euro and the Eurosystem should first and foremost be measured in terms of its stability. Stability is the basic requirement of a good currency. And the euro enjoys stability, as proven by the latest inflation data for the euro area, corresponding to the month of February 1999, which - measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) - reflected an annual increase of 0.8%.  The success of the euro cannot, however, be measured by the evolution of its exchange rate in relation to other currencies. The fact that since 1 January 1999 the effective nominal exchange rate of the euro has depreciated is of much less relevance than the sound inflation rates. In the long run the strength of a currency and its stability move together.  We say that in order to measure the success of the euro the level of inflation is of relevance and not the exchange rate, mainly because inflation depends basically - but not exclusively - on the action of the Eurosystem, while the exchange rate of the euro depends on the macroeconomic fundamentals of the euro area, the evolution of other currencies and market expectations, against which it is preferable not to act. We would have to ask ourselves to what extent the evolution of the euro reflects the strength of the dollar rather than the weakness of the euro. And, finally, we Europeans must be conscious of the fact that, with the parities of 10 of our currencies irrevocably fixed, the external exchange rate for our respective economies is now of less importance than before.  Regarding the objective of price stability, let me remind you that reaching price stability is the main responsibility of the ECB, but it cannot be achieved by the ECB alone. Stability concerns the whole society, and this is precisely why we speak of a \""stability culture\"". Governments in particular are, of course, also involved in the achievement of stability by applying an appropriate economic policy. Complying with the Stability and Growth Pact or implementing structural reforms in the markets to foster competition are key elements in this respect.  The remaining task in connection with the primary objective of the ESCB was undertaken by the ECB last autumn and consisted in providing a quantitative definition of price stability. This definition, in the exact terms approved by the Governing Council of the ECB, reads as follows: \""Price stability shall be defined as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%\"". And the Governing Council added that price stability will be \""maintained over the medium term\"".  I should like to make some comments regarding this definition of stability. First of all, I should like to underline that this is a definition and, therefore, it is a lasting commitment, and not simply an objective for a limited period of time to be revised on an annual basis, for instance. Second, you should note that we use the term \""increase\"" and not \""variation\"", meaning that a decrease in the HICP (or deflation) is not consistent with the idea of stability. Third, we specify the index to be used to measure inflation, the HICP. Although we should always be open to future improvements, let me state that this index, prepared by Eurostat, is good enough. It takes into account very hi-tech items such as computers, and it is a \""price index\"" and not a \""cost of living index\"". This explains the fact that it does not fully cover owner-occupied housing costs, for example, it excludes imputed rents. Fourth, what the ECB must really consider is the euro area-wide trend of inflation and not the specific figures for each country. Fifth, we understand that it is appropriate to allow a range of stability and not a single figure, in order to give room for some possible measurement bias in the HICP (Boskin effect) and also, in my opinion, to introduce the idea of intensity of stability, which I shall explain later. Sixth, it must be stressed that stability has to be understood in a medium-term perspective, disregarding short-term volatility. And, finally, why precisely below 2%? This limit is, of course, a convention. It could be 2.5% instead, just the same as the speed limit could be 90 kmph instead of 80 kmph. But, on the other hand, stability cannot be defined as an increase in prices of, say, up to 4%, just as 160 kmph is not a real speed limit. The substance underlying the 2% limit is that the price increase should take measurement bias into account. This limit should be low enough to avoid significant distortions in price setting and to make any general indexation process unnecessary. Following our example, the limit must take into account the lack of precision of the car's speedometer and discourage reckless driving.  To sum up, the ECB has completed an important task defining in very precise terms the concept of stability, which is its main responsibility.  Besides stability, which is the primary objective of the ESCB, the Maastricht Treaty refers to a secondary objective in Article 105: \""Without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the Community, with a view to contributing to the achievement of objectives of the Community as laid down in Article 2\"". Among other things, Article 2 refers to \""sustainable and non-inflationary growth respecting the environment\"" and to a \""high level of employment and of social protection\"". Although, without a doubt, the outstanding objective of the ESCB, its real \""raison d'être\"", is to pursue stability, this secondary objective implies that the ECB, when taking decisions on monetary policy, has responsibilities in the field of economic growth and employment. General, indirect and conditional responsibilities, but responsibilities nevertheless.  Let me add that denying these responsibilities does not enhance the ESCB's commitment to stability. On the contrary, fundamentalism is not the best approach when trying to convince others of an idea. In order to be convincing I rather prefer to use rational arguments, which imply, among other things, an awareness of the global picture surrounding an idea. Let me also add that we must be aware that the main risk for the present consensus on the \""culture of stability\"" stems, precisely, from the unacceptably high level of unemployment in our countries.  My personal understanding of this secondary objective of the ESCB is that, in the long run, the best contribution that the ECB can make in favour of sustainable growth and of a high level of employment is, precisely, providing an atmosphere of stability. Stability implies efficient allocation of resources, competitiveness, lower interest rate risk premiums, investment, job creation and protection of the value of incomes, savings and wealth. All these factors are preconditions for economic growth, a high level of employment and social protection or, in other words, preconditions for the fulfilment of the secondary objective of the ESCB. In securing its objective of stability, the Eurosystem creates the conditions for complying with the other objectives of the European Union.  Does this mean that the motto of the ECB should be \""only stability matters\"" or \""the greater stability, the better\""? Of course not. We should recognise that, in the short run, there could be a trade-off between the degree of stability and growth. Let me stress that I am speaking of a trade-off between the degree of stability and growth, and not between stability itself and growth. To put it in a more technical way, monetary policy affects both prices and quantities in the short run.  Intensity of stability matters in the short run. In terms of economic growth, a degree of stability of, for example, a 0.5% increase in the HICP would not mean the same as a degree of stability of, for example, 1.5% increase of HICP, especially if a significantly tighter monetary policy is required to achieve the former. The required degree of monetary policy tightness will depend, among other factors, on the economic cycle and on exogenous variables such as commodity prices. In the short run, assuming an inflationary scenario, the pace or rhythm of movement towards stability can also have effects in terms of economic growth. The right moment to make decisions, the timing, also matters: it must be neither too early nor too late, so as not to affect growth expectations. To summarise, in the short run, \""stability: the deeper, the faster, the sooner, the better\"" is not always the best guidance for monetary policy. Actually, hitting the mark is more than a technique, it is a real art form: the so-called \""art of central banking\"".    The strategy   Another very important decision of the ECB was the choice of monetary policy strategy. Strategy is the guidance which makes good decisions possible and which is, therefore, a vital element of the internal decision-making process. Moreover, a well-defined strategy explains the reasons for taking a certain decision, and thus enables the markets and the public to understand, interpret and judge correctly the central bank's performance. You should bear in mind that the way in which a measure is interpreted is as important for monetary policy as, so to speak, the \""mechanical\"" effect of the measure itself. A misinterpreted measure can reverse the impact it was intended to have. A correct strategy promotes credibility and confidence and therefore enhances the effectiveness of monetary policy. Last but not least, the strategy of monetary policy, as well as a precise definition of its primary objective, is closely linked to the idea of accountability.  The European Monetary Institute (EMI) and later the ECB were confronted with three possible, let us say, \""pure models\"" of monetary policy strategy: the exchange rate strategy, the intermediate monetary targeting strategy and the direct inflation targeting strategy.  The first one (the exchange rate strategy) was discarded by the EMI from the very beginning. It can be useful in the case of a small open economy, which has close economic links to a major one with a high degree of stability. In that specific case, pegging the exchange rate to the stable currency is a way to \""import\"" stability and avoid any disturbance in the economic exchanges between the two countries, but it implies giving up monetary policy autonomy. Needless to say this is not the case for the euro area given its size or for the euro vis-à-vis any other currency in the world.  Regarding this point, let me make some more general comments about the possibility of co-ordinating or limiting the fluctuations of the euro exchange rate in relation to other currencies outside the ESCB, in particular the US dollar. Having regard to the desirability of reducing, as far as possible, the relative volatility of the dollar and the euro, it should nevertheless be affirmed that the establishment, officially or unofficially, implicitly or explicitly, of certain fluctuation bands between the exchange rates of the dollar and of the euro would represent an error of economic policy. This idea is therefore dismissed by the ECB. It is important to emphasise in this connection the impossibility of simultaneously achieving two independent objectives - price stability and exchange rate stability - with the single instrumentation of monetary policy.  The only specific case in which this possibility occurs is, indeed, pegging the exchange rate to a stable currency as a way to secure stability in line with an exchange rate strategy for monetary policy, as I have already said. Otherwise, if there were a set fluctuation bands for the euro exchange rate, the said exchange rate objective could come into conflict with price stability and the ECB would not be fulfilling its primary objective. Simultaneously having pegged exchange rates, free movement of capital and monetary autonomy is simply impossible. This is precisely the reason why the countries of the Eurosystem have transferred their monetary autonomy to the ECB, which acts as a single monetary authority within an economic area whose exchange rates are completely fixed (the single currency) and with free movement of capital (the single market). And exactly the same argument explains why two different monetary authorities, each with its own decision-making autonomy (the US Federal Reserve and the ECB) in an environment of free movement of capital, cannot hope to peg or even to co-ordinate the exchange rates of their respective currencies successfully in the face of deep-rooted divergent trends in the markets.  Instead of establishing exchange rate fluctuation bands, European experience has shown that certain good common macroeconomic fundamentals represent the best strategy for achieving a better co-ordination of exchange rates.  Let us go back to the ECB's monetary policy strategy. Discarding the exchange rate strategy for the reasons explained above, the ECB selected a monetary policy strategy of its own which contains elements of pure intermediate monetary targeting and pure direct inflation targeting.  By doing so, the ECB avoided any kind of polarisation between these two strategies. They are, certainly, different, but not opposite nor contradictory. They complement each other. And indeed, it is possible to take elements from one or the other and build a new and authentic strategy.  As you probably know, the ECB's own strategy, which in my opinion deserves a better label than the descriptive \""stability-oriented monetary policy strategy\"", comprises two pillars. First, a quantitative reference value for the growth rate of M3 of 4½%. This percentage derives - in the context of a medium-term framework - from Fisher's quantity equation, using the definition of stability and realistic hypothesis of the trend growth of GDP (between 2% and 2.5%) and the trend decline in velocity of money (between -0.5% and -1%). The second pillar of our monetary policy strategy consists of a broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments and risks to stability obtained from a wide range of economic indicators (growth prospects, wage developments, fiscal variables, the euro exchange rate, raw material prices, import prices, monetary and credit aggregates, long-term market interest rates, and so on). Notice that the link between the secondary objective of the ESCB and its strategy occurs in this second pillar, where growth prospects are an important indicator of price developments.  Why a new strategy with two pillars? Because we are dealing with a new currency regulated by a new institution in a new economic area. The term \""new\"" conveys the idea of \""uncertainty\"" to the prudent. The best way to clear up uncertainties is to rely as much as possible not on one or the other, but on all successful past experiences of the NCBs, and not to make only one strong bet.  Thus, the ECB's monetary policy strategy takes or combines elements of the two strategies used by most NCBs of the euro area, which is not the same as combining the two strategies. Instead of a monetary target, the ECB prefers to have a monetary reference value, because, for the time being, the ECB cannot afford to miss a target, as the Deutsche Bundesbank did, without losing credibility. No one should expect a systematic and mechanical reaction of the ECB when deviations from the reference value occur. Moreover, the ECB does not publish inflation forecasts, nor does it set an annual inflation objective, as the Bank of England does now and the Banco de España did in the past, although it has a precise definition of stability.  The touchstone of a good monetary policy strategy is how clear and predictable the so-called reaction function of monetary policy is. In my opinion, the ECB's monetary policy strategy makes it possible to understand decisions, whether \""passive ones\"" (not changing anything) or \""active ones\"" (moving interest rates). The expectations and reactions surrounding the 8 April interest rate move are a good example of this.  The ECB's monetary policy strategy has been accused of opacity, of a lack of transparency. I do not think this is true. I think rather that one must not confuse opacity with discretion, transparency with automatism. I can accept that there is no automatism in the ECB's strategy, in the sense that monetary policy decisions do not feed back from a change in specific variables. In the dilemma between rules and discretion, I admit that the ECB is closer to discretion. After all, who really believes in rules robust enough to eliminate the need for discretion in monetary policy decisions? Who really thinks that the Friedman rule or the Taylor rule is more than a meritorious academic contribution to monetary policy theory, useful only as background material? Who genuinely believes that these and other similar rules can be used as a real guide to take monetary policy decisions?    Instruments   No central bank has compiled in its manual of procedures such a wide range of monetary policy instruments as those listed in the so-called \""General Documentation\"" of the ESCB. (From the European Central Bank publication entitled \""The single monetary policy in Stage Three: General documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures\"", dated September 1998.) There is no special merit to this. Open market operations of various types, with several maturities and frequencies and for different purposes, are easy to specify, taking advantage of the rich experience of our NCBs. At the same time, establishing standing facilities or a remunerated minimum reserve is within the reach of any central bank.  All these instruments with their different varieties and procedures have their pros and cons, advantages and drawbacks. The merit lies in being able to assess these pros and cons in a proper manner and in choosing the best instrument and procedure for each situation. The merit also lies in changing the instruments and procedures whenever necessary. The ECB has done so and is prepared to do so in the future.  In the first days of single monetary policy, there was little doubt of the advantages of a fixed rate tender with a certain percentage of allotment for the weekly main refinancing operation. It makes it possible to control both price and quantities. It avoids giving wrong signals to the market and liquidity can be kept under control. The idea of control is fundamental at the very beginning of the life of a currency and an institution. In the meantime, the ECB has improved some specific procedures in order to avoid or, at least, to minimise problems arising from the fact that the availability of collateral varies.  However, as I said before, no system is without drawbacks. In the case of a fixed rate tender with allotment, problems can arise in the case of some banking institutions (or \""counterparties\"" as we call them) operating in financial systems with a scarcity of collateral for several reasons: a low level of public debt, less tradition of loan securitisation, etc. As examples of Eurosystem decisions to improve the procedures in order to avoid or minimise these kinds of problems, I shall mention two steps. One was clarifying to the counterparties that the correct interpretation of the General Documentation allows tender bids which are not actually covered by collateral at the time of the submission of bids, and that the only requirement is the financial capacity to have the collateral on the date of settlement of the tender. Of course, the final settlement of the tender operation is subject to the availability of sufficient collateral to cover the allotted amount. The second step, taken on 8 April 1999 when we decided to reduce the interest rates, was to establish a symmetric interest rate corridor between the repo rate on the one hand and the marginal lending facility and the marginal deposit facility on the other. The markets could - and it actually seems that they did - infer that the overnight rate will tend to move around the middle point of the marginal facilities corridor. If this is so, it is better for the time being (but not necessarily forever) to have a symmetric corridor in order to signal that there is no reason for the overnight rate to stay necessarily above the repo rate. By doing so, we avoid systematic arbitrage gains stemming from financial institutions asking for more liquidity than they actually need. This is legitimate provided that they do not ask for more liquidity than the amount of collateral they can afford, but it gives a clear advantage to institutions operating in financial systems with a large stock of collateral.  Another good example of the Eurosystem choosing the appropriate instrument of monetary policy and of changing details of its application concerns the longer-term refinancing operations, which have a monthly frequency and a maturity of three months. Unlike the main refinancing operations, these consist of a variable rate tender, which is not intended to have its usual signalling effect. As you may know, the signalling effect of monetary policy is important and must be taken into account whenever choosing the appropriate instrument and using it. For the sake of efficiency, the Governing Council of the ECB decided on 4 March 1999 to modify the tender method applying to longer-term refinancing operations, switching from a variable single rate auction (the so-called Dutch method) to a variable multiple rate auction (the American method).  Rather than describing to you all the Eurosystem's monetary policy tools in the part of my speech devoted to monetary policy implementation, I preferred to give you some examples of which instruments were chosen and on which grounds, and to demonstrate that an important task in these first 100 days of European Monetary Union has been to improve these instruments with a view to efficiency and fairness.   OTHER FUNCTIONS OF THE ESCB  Nothing is more important for the conduct of monetary policy than good statistics. In this respect, I should like to highlight the progress, which the ESCB has made in this field, thanks to the efforts of the staff of both the ECB and of the NCBs. The ESCB has direct responsibility for preparing money and banking statistics and those relating to financial accounts. It also has shared responsibility with EUROSTAT (European Commission) for balance of payments statistics. Although the work has not yet been concluded, I wish to emphasise that the progress made has been considerable and that we now have the basic statistical information required for our monetary policy strategy and for taking appropriate decisions. As I often say when I comment on this point, you do not need a scalpel to cut a slice of bread.  It is my understanding that, after 100 days of running, the payment systems function of the ESCB has had a positive result on balance. Following an expected learning and adjustment period to become accustomed to the new procedures and techniques, the real-time gross settlement system (TARGET) is functioning well. And, more importantly, the ESCB has alternative methods and contingency solutions, which can always be introduced if considered necessary or opportune.  As the person directly responsible for the information and communication systems of the ECB, I must say - and this is not to my credit but to the credit of the staff of the ECB - that the information systems in general, and, in particular, both the technical infrastructure allowing the instantaneous transmission of data on monetary policy, and the communication systems required to co-ordinate the activity of the NCBs and of the ECB, are functioning perfectly.  Another one of my specific responsibilities at the ECB involves the production and issuance of euro banknotes. Several milestones were reached already on our road to prepare the euro banknotes, which will be issued in the year 2002. Thus, we decided in favour of a no pooling decentralised solution for the production of banknotes by the NCBs. We have finalised the so-called \""zero production run\"", which involved the printing works of the participating countries. The main purposes of this test were, first, to check the compliance of the \""test banknotes\"" against the technical specifications and, second, to prove that all printing works are in a position to produce the euro banknotes to the same high quality standards. The result of this test was positive, as only some minor technical specifications need to be modified slightly. The printing works will now start their final preparations for the commencement of the mass production of the euro banknotes. The Governing Council also decided to establish an Analysis Centre for Counterfeit Euro Banknotes. As is already indicated by its name, the main purpose of this Analysis Centre will be to technically analyse and classify new types of printed counterfeits, and to store the related technical data in a database. The Analysis Centre will be located at the ECB in Frankfurt.   FURTHER PERSPECTIVES OF THE EURO AND THE ESCB  The future perspectives of the euro and the ESCB, to come to the last part of the title of my contribution, are clearly linked to the ideas of confidence and credibility.  The main goals I am striving to achieve concerning the future perspectives of the euro and of the ESCB are, indeed, confidence and credibility. All the technical achievements in monetary policy, payment systems, information systems, statistics, etc. are worth nothing if the euro and the ESCB do not manage to win the confidence of the 292 million citizens of the euro area, as the Deutsche Bundesbank did with the 82 million German citizens.  The key to gaining confidence in the ESCB is, first, to be efficient, to be successful, in meeting the primary objective of price stability, for which an appropriate monetary policy is a necessary but not sufficient condition. As stated before, in order to achieve stability, it is necessary to combine and co-ordinate with other economic policies, such as fiscal policy (Growth and Stability Pact) and those relating to the supply side of the economy (liberalisation, deregulation and flexibility).  It is also essential for the credibility of the ESCB that there is respect for its independence, with regard to the various functional, organic and personal aspects which independence encompasses.  Independence does not mean no co-ordination or no communication, or a lack of transparency, or a lack of accountability. Accountability to the European Parliament and good communication with the public and with the markets is an essential condition for the credibility of the ESCB and for the efficiency of its monetary policy. As I said before, it is important to remember that the impact of the monetary policy measures depends both on their mechanical effect and on their perception and interpretation by the public and by the markets.  A further key to the success of the ESCB is that it should act as what it is, a system, that is to say a harmonious and interdependent whole. Co-ordination between the ECB and the NCBs, which up to now has been fully achieved, mainly thanks to the actions of the Governing Council and of the committees, is another factor for the euro.  Last but not least, a further key to the credibility of the euro and of the ESCB is the adoption of a European-wide perspective, with no national bias.  Efficiency, independence, accountability, transparency and communication, co-ordination and a European-wide perspective: these are the main ruling principles of the ESCB. They are certainly demanding conditions, but they are necessary in order to achieve credibility on the part of Europeans and those who wish to view the euro as a currency on which they can rely.  Thank you very much.",1
"18","18th Frankfurt European Banking Congress   Statement by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBFrankfurt am Main, 21 November 2008 Ladies and gentlemen, This year’s European Banking Congress takes place at a very challenging point in time. Today’s event is therefore a particularly important one. It is a pleasure to be here amid so many distinguished participants and to be joined on this panel by my central bank colleagues from Brazil and the United Arab Emirates.  We are at a critical juncture as far as the set-up and functioning of the international financial system is concerned. The current financial crisis was triggered by a widespread and substantial undervaluation of risk. When the crisis erupted in August 2007, it was at first a systemic threat to the liquidity of the financial system, which mainly affected advanced economies. In mid-September of this year the crisis deteriorated very significantly and turned into a systemic threat to the solvency of important parts of the global financial system. It is no longer limited to advanced economies and is instead also affecting emerging economies. In addition, it has spilled over from the financial sphere to the real economy.  Global challenges call for global responses. Policy-makers across the globe have responded and are taking appropriate action to contain and alleviate the crisis. Central banks are playing a pivotal role in this regard, providing the necessary liquidity – sometimes in ways that were scarcely imaginable up until a few months ago – in order to ensure that financial markets and institutions can continue to function. As far as the ECB is concerned, I would like to point out once again that we have acted decisively from the very beginning of the turmoil in August of last year. At that time, when the threat to the liquidity of the financial system first emerged, we provided the system with no less than EUR 95 billion of liquidity within a few hours. Later that year, the ECB also began to supply liquidity to European counterparties in US dollars through swap arrangements which we established with the Federal Reserve. Since October of this year, we have been granting full allotments in our monetary operations. These are only some of the key measures taken by the ECB in order to support financial markets, and you see from the design of these measures that some of them are literally without precedent.  * * * At the same time as we are dealing with the current crisis, we also need to look ahead and strengthen the functioning and resilience of the international financial system. A reform agenda for this system will need to comprise many elements. I would like to reiterate three principal elements that I consider fundamental.      First, short-termism – that is to say, the excessive focus on short-term returns – has to be addressed. As we have seen, modern financial systems have shown a particular preference for instruments and intermediaries that have promised significant returns in the short term. Short-termism can lead to the misjudgement of underlying risk. It can also encourage excessive risk-taking on the basis of relatively small amounts of capital. It is therefore essential to establish the right incentives for market participants, including the use of appropriate internal compensation schemes.    Second, it is essential that transparency be increased in various components of the global financial system – for financial instruments, markets and institutions. Transparency is a key prerequisite for the efficient functioning of markets, and one that prevents markets from overreacting, both on the upside and on the downside. It can thereby help to reduce the scope for “herding behaviour” and contagion. To give two examples, regulators need to tighten up disclosure requirements for markets in which structured financial products are traded and strengthen reporting requirements for unregulated institutions which are relevant for systemic stability.   Third, it is important to reduce the pro-cyclicality of the financial system, namely its potential to amplify business cycle fluctuations and trigger financial instability. Drivers of pro-cyclical behaviour need to be addressed, to restrain financial institutions’ excessive risk-taking in upturns and to discourage their excessive conservatism when credit to companies and households is most needed. Elements of financial regulation, such as capital requirements, provisioning rules and valuation standards, can act as contributing factors in this regard. A considerable amount of work is under way with a view to addressing the issue of pro-cyclicality, with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision having primary competence in this field and the Financial Stability Forum playing an important coordinating role.      These three reform elements are of particular relevance to the functioning and resilience of the international financial system. Taken together, these changes will foster greater “discipline” in the system. Greater discipline means a reduced likelihood of unwarranted fluctuations, a more appropriate assessment of risks and a better balance between short and long-term investment horizons. In my view, the meetings preparatory to the G20 – in particular the meeting at the level of Ministers and Governors in São Paulo – and the G20 summit itself have brought us a step closer in this regard, as these elements and many further important measures are reflected in the communiqué and the action plan. * * * But changes to the financial system itself are only one side of the coin as regards the measures that need to be taken in order to prevent a crisis like this from happening again. The other side of the coin relates to macroeconomic policies – another issue discussed at the G20 summit. Specifically, we also need to foster greater discipline in the macroeconomic policy-making of all participants in the global economy. Large domestic and external imbalances have to be reduced in systemically important economies, as their build-up and unwinding can ultimately trigger spill-over effects in the global economy as a whole. Hence, countries should pursue policies that are stability-oriented and sustainable over the medium and long term. One vital element in order to foster such policies is effective surveillance by the IMF. This brings me to the organisation and functioning of international institutions and fora, which are key actors in the global financial architecture. It is important to have in place a well-functioning surveillance framework which identifies imbalances in a timely fashion and encourages the implementation of corrective measures. The current crisis highlights the fact that the IMF needs to gain more traction as regards systemically important countries. This will not be straightforward, but the IMF’s Multilateral Consultations, which foresee a direct exchange between key members of the global economy, represent a process that should be vigorously developed for this purpose.  In terms of governance, there is merit in the international community engaging with emerging market economies in a way that reflects their systemic relevance, thereby making the key international financial institutions and fora more inclusive.  So far, I have focused primarily on the tasks that policy-makers are confronted with. But the financial industry also has a very important role to play. As regards the very short term, let me refer to the interbank market. Indeed, it is of paramount importance that the banking sector as a whole takes advantage of the efforts made by central banks and governments and contributes to the normalisation of market conditions. This could be achieved by committing to reigniting the interbank money market and resuming the intermediation function.  In conclusion, while the challenges we are currently facing are truly formidable, central banks in general, and the ECB in particular, are doing everything they can to support the functioning of the financial system. Moreover, market participants and other actors should be assured that the cooperation within the global network of central banks has been excellent and highly conducive to addressing the ongoing challenges.  Thank you for your attention.",1
"19","20 years of ESCB statistics: Past achievements and future challenges   Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, Ninth ECB Statistics Conference, \""20 years of ESCB statistics: What's next?\"", Frankfurt, 10 July 2018 Ladies and gentlemen, I believe the words of the late US politician Daniel Moynihan are a good starting point tonight. He famously said, “Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts”. I would add that the best opinions are certainly rooted in facts. And, since we seem to have entered the age of “alternative facts”, I have been reflecting on what real facts are, and how to defend them. And it’s not just the age of “alternative facts”; it’s also the age of “fake news”. Still, neither of these concepts is entirely new. For as long as there has been public discourse, people have been tempted to propagate their own take on reality. And not all of them have been able to resist this temptation. But still, something has changed. Today, Twitter and other tools allow almost anyone to communicate with the general public. And fake news is most successful in creating alternative facts when people stop trusting traditional sources of information. This is what’s happening right now, all around us. Traditional media have come under attack. Some people place as much trust in an anonymous tweet or Facebook post as they do in an article in the Financial Times, Le Monde or El País. Some people see “fake news” as real news and “alternative facts” as a solid basis for taking decisions. So, can data and statistics help to counter “alternative facts” and “fake news”? Can they help to build a more solid base for making decisions? Well, over the years, it has become somewhat fashionable to doubt the ability of statistics to shed light on the facts, on the truth. I am sure that every statistician in the room has been told more than once that “there are three kinds of lies: lies, damn lies and statistics”. Ironically, the quote has been attributed to so many different people that its true source is unknown. So tonight, I think we should focus on how we can defend statistics and good data as a source of facts. One of the key questions is how we can engage with those who doubt us. In my view, there are two things we need to do. The first is to admit that real-world statistics have their limits, and to be transparent about how and when we use judgement. The second is to ensure that we, as institutions and as individual experts, earn people’s trust. Statistics is a discipline that is certainly aware of its own limits: it not only acknowledges uncertainty, it quantifies it! But we must also admit that there is not just scope, but also a need, to apply judgement when producing good data and statistics. And trust plays a key role here. People can trust the ECB and the national central banks to apply expert judgement when it is needed.  In my speech today, I will focus on key ingredients that have been crucial in building up the ECB’s good reputation over the past 20 years. The first is to have good data and to use them well when taking decisions. The second is to ensure good cooperation. The third is to keep pace with changing times.  Good data for good decisions I am aware that the need for good data may seem self-explanatory, especially for an audience of statisticians. But that doesn’t make it less important, particularly in the case of the ECB. The stakes are extremely high: whether for monetary policy or banking supervision, our decisions impact the lives of over 340 million people. This gives the data we use, and the analysis we carry out, enormous importance.  Our data need to be reliable and our statistics sound. Only then will they be able to form the basis for good decisions. But not all data are created equal. Even well-collected data may fall short of answering the burning questions of our experts. With the 2008 crisis, for example, we learned the hard way why better and more granular data are necessary. Aggregate data provided us with the big picture of the euro area economy and its financial markets. But the big picture was too blurry. And, at times, it was downright misleading. Money markets were a good example. After all, money markets are where the transmission of monetary policy starts. Prior to the crisis, the ECB collected microdata on these markets through the Euro Money Market Survey, the EMMS for short. This survey shed light on what was happening in the money markets during the crisis. For example, in unsecured markets, we could see that euro area banks were taking fewer counterparty risks with banks from other euro area countries. But our vision was limited. First, we didn’t collect direct information on market rates, so we didn’t know how much each market participant was paying for liquidity. If we had had a full picture of the dispersion of rates, we would have had less need to read between the lines. Second, we only published the EMMS annually, which seriously limited the potential for research and analysis. Research on a crisis that was developing by the hour could not be based on data published once a year. But we understood the shortcomings of the data and got to work. In 2016, we started to collect money market statistical reporting, or MMSR, data. The MMSR data include trade-by-trade granular data on four market segments. This means we receive full information on each trade – the maturity date, the rate, the counterparty, the collateral and more. Data on the unsecured market segment are published every six to eight weeks. With this project the ECB took an important step towards the future, becoming a collector of “big data”. But, of course, we didn’t do this on our own. A tale of cooperation Cooperation is often mentioned at conferences like this one. But in the field of statistics, it is simply a reality that you won’t get very far if you don’t cooperate with others. Projects such as the MMSR would never have come into being without good cooperation. In fact, the genesis of the MMSR involved the central banks of four countries – Germany, France, Italy and Spain – and the ECB. And of course, these institutions needed to cooperate with reporting banks. And cooperation happens not only between institutions, but also within institutions: the constant feedback loop between departments using the data and those preparing them leads to high-quality results. But smooth cooperation has helped us from the start. It allowed the Eurosystem to achieve its objectives from day one, 20 years ago. Thanks to a joint effort by the entire Eurosystem, we had a set of harmonised euro area statistics from the very beginning of the ECB’s existence. And some 16 years later, when European banking supervision came into being, the Directorate General Statistics was able to provide the supervisory data we needed right from the start – thanks to another joint effort. Indeed, as the ECB’s functions have expanded, statistics have had to follow. And of course, as we have found ourselves needing more data to do our job, banks have found themselves having to report not only more data, but also more granular data. We try at all times to be mindful of the reporting burden that banks have to bear. Regular merit and cost procedures are applied to new data collections. More recently, we have started to hold public consultations on proposed new statistical reporting requirements. This will help to ensure all stakeholders have the chance to express their views. Cooperation also helps us to make reporting more efficient, which in turn reduces the burden on banks. And here, we have worked on two fronts. With the ESCB Integrated Reporting Framework, we aim to aggregate and harmonise banks’ reporting requirements. With the Banks’ Integrated Reporting Dictionary, the BIRD, we support banks in organising their data with a view to reporting it more efficiently. Towards this end, experts from national central banks work with experts from commercial banks to define the data and data transformations needed to comply with the reporting requirements for AnaCredit and the Securities Holdings Statistics. So, banks that choose to participate are being helped to do a job they would otherwise have had to do on their own. Cooperation with institutions beyond the ESCB has also been vital. The members of the ESCB and the European Statistical System partnership have worked closely to ensure the production of complete and coherent European statistics. We – central banks and statistical institutes – have been doing this with remarkable results in the Committee for Monetary, Financial and Balance of Payments Statistics since 1991. And since 2013, we also meet in the European Statistical Forum to discuss topics of strategic cooperation with the heads of national statistical institutes. Keeping pace It’s clear that cooperation is key to getting our job done. But these days, a job well done requires much more than it used to. Central banks need to keep pace with a world that is changing at an ever-faster pace. How do we do that? How do we keep pace? Well, for one thing, we need to be open to new ways of doing things. On this front, I am sure the two words on everyone’s minds are “big” and “data”. It’s true that we central bankers have not exactly been at the forefront of the big data revolution. After all, we are a bit cautious by nature. And we know that big data means different things to different people; and we know that we cannot yet say with certainty which big data applications will be truly useful  Big data are quite different from traditional, structured data. So we have much to learn and many challenges to tackle. Collecting the data is only where the challenges start. We also need to adapt verification processes to ensure that the data are of high quality. And this is where big data already pay off, indirectly at least. Big data has brought us tools and techniques that can be applied to rapidly process large sets of traditional data too. This makes it much easier for us to realise projects like MMSR and AnaCredit and helps us to keep pace with an ever-changing world. AnaCredit, for instance, involves immense sets of extremely granular data, reflecting the far greater complexity and interconnectedness of today’s economy. To understand this complexity and assess the interconnections, we need a very detailed view. And this is exactly what AnaCredit gives us. Thanks to the granular data it provides, we will be better able to understand what is driving credit growth, making it easier to know whether such growth is healthy or not. MMSR, on the other hand, is about speed: money markets move fast and never stop. So taking a snapshot every now and then does not suffice. We need much faster data, and that’s what MMSR provides. It allows us to constantly assess who lends how much money to whom in the money market and at what rates. This gives us a very clear and quick picture of how the market is structured, how exposed players are to one another and how vulnerable they are.  And MMSR helps us to keep pace in other ways too. Look at the important role benchmark rates play. They provide anchors for contracts in financial markets and are important for the transmission of monetary policy. The ECB thus decided to develop a benchmark rate: a new daily euro short-term rate, also known as ESTER. This rate will complement existing rates by the private sector and serve as a backstop to them. The ECB will start publishing ESTER by October 2019. This project will entail significant challenges. Every working day, we will need to produce a reliable rate, based on individual transactions. This will need to happen within a very narrow time frame, while ensuring full quality control.  Leadership Ladies and gentlemen, I have talked a lot about past achievements and future challenges. And I have talked about the need to work together as a team. But, of course, all good teams need good leaders. And speaking of good leaders brings me to Aurel Schubert. As Aurel is due to retire soon, I would like to take the opportunity tonight to say a few words about what he has done for this institution. For eight years now, he has steered the ECB statistics ship with great competence. Aurel has made invaluable contributions to some of our most ambitious projects: the granular Securities Holdings Statistics, the MMSR and Anacredit. Thanks to his leadership, supervisory statistics were available from the start of European banking supervision. He helped amend our statistical legal framework to align it with international standards. But, of course, his career started long before he became Director General of Statistics. He has worked in the field since 1997. Over these past 21 years, he has participated in 90 meetings of the Statistics Committee and chaired 34 of them. He has also been a Vice-Chair of the Irving Fisher Committee, a Co-Chair of the European Statistical Forum, and Chair of the ESRB contact group on data. All these achievements are facts, of course. And they show that Aurel knows his subject, thinks strategically and masters the politics. These are all important aspects of being a good leader. But they are not the only things that are important. A leader cannot act alone; they rely on other people. And Aurel is an outstanding people manager. I think he can teach us all a thing or two when it comes to forming a team, keeping people motivated, managing change and, most important of all, creating an atmosphere of trust and mutual respect. In that sense, I see him as a role model. Aurel, I thank you very much. Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, In my speech tonight, I have reminded you of some of your many achievements, both recent and past. But what matters most is not the next big project or the latest database. What matters most are the high professional standards which you have all maintained in your work. And, if we want to keep fighting alternative facts with real facts and fake news with real news, you must continue on this path with the same conviction as you started out with in 1998. And now let me conclude with a fact of life that is all too true: dinner speeches are always too long. There is no way to spin this any other way. So thank you for all your good work, and thank you for your attention.

"20","2011 Bernácer Prize Award Ceremony in honour of Lasse Heje Pedersen   Speech by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, Madrid, 28 June 2012 Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great pleasure for me to address a few words to you in honour of this year’s winner of the 2011 Bernácer Prize, Professor Lasse Pedersen from New York University. The developments on the global financial markets that we have been witnessing in the past years are unprecedented in nature and have raised a number of challenges for policy makers and central banks alike. In times like these it is more important than ever that we use the advice of the brightest and most talented scholars in order to find answers to complex questions and develop effective tools with real-world applicability in order to combat the potentially adverse effects of financial instability without jeopardizing our primary mandate of medium-term price stability. Without doubt, Lasse Pedersen has been one of the leading minds that have re-shaped our thinking about financial markets, as his contributions during the past decade have greatly improved our understanding of the driving forces behind systemic financial crises and the propagation of liquidity shocks across markets and throughout the economy.  Naturally, academic research plays an important role for central banks in general because it provides the foundations for the conduct of monetary policy and its impact on the real economy. The Eurosystem is no exception to this and naturally finds itself in constant exchange with the global research community in the form of research seminars and conferences as well as regular academic visitors. Moreover the ECB regularly funds policy-relevant academic research via the Lamfalussy Fellowship. In 2010, the Eurosystem launched the Macroprudential Research Network MaRs with the objective to develop core conceptual frameworks, models and tools that would provide research support in order to improve macro-prudential supervision in the European Union.  Lasse Pedersen’s research focuses on the role of liquidity in financial markets. While much of the classical theory of asset pricing assumes a frictionless world, his work departs from this idealisation and acknowledges that real-world features such as the institutional structure of the way capital is invested around the globe have profound implications for both the determination of asset prices as well as for the stability of the financial system itself. Today, most trade in financial markets – be it stocks, bonds, currencies, or derivatives - does not take place between individuals but rather financial institutions such as banks and investment firms. This has important implications for the functioning of these markets because it introduces several important types of frictions. As we have all witnessed in the past years, many of these entities are very large, at least in terms of their balance sheets. Besides giving rise to the too-big-to-fail problem that has been at the heart of the current financial crisis, the size of these financial institutions has profound implications for the way investment portfolios are constructed and assets are traded, because it makes a large difference whether an agent wants to buy or sell 100 shares or 100,000 shares. For large investors, the impact of their actions on market prices is no longer negligible and they potentially incur large transaction costs due to “market impact”, such that fluctuations in market liquidity – the ease with which a security can be transformed into cash – become a first-order concern. Based on this real-world insight, Acharya and Pedersen developed the liquidity adjusted Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) [1], which shows that investors do not only require compensation for bearing the risk associated to an asset’s fundamentals but also will command an additional premium related to the asset’s liquidity risk. Their theory is strongly supported by numerous empirical studies and can explain real-world phenomena such as the episodes of a flight to liquidity that we have witnessed more than once during the past years. Another salient feature of financial institutions that has featured prominently in the current financial crisis is leverage. In fact, most market participants do not finance their entire trading positions with equity but rather fund part of their investments by pledging the securities as collateral in repurchase agreements and asset-backed commercial paper. This implies that asset prices are also affected by funding liquidity, a concept that refers to the ease with which a security can be used to raise outside capital. In the years preceding the 2007-2008 financial crisis, leverage in the financial sector build up steadily fuelled by high demand for dollar-denominated short-term debt in conjunction with low interest rates. When the first rumours of problems in the market for sub-prime mortgages began to spread, uncertainty of exposures to potential losses directly translated into funding liquidity problems. In an equally rigorous and elegant contribution, Pedersen and his co-author Markus Brunnermeier – Winner of the 2008 Bernácer Prize - show how shocks to funding liquidity and market liquidity can reinforce each other and culminate in a downward spiral that gives rise to financial instability and systemic risk [2]. If funding conditions worsen, initial losses on leveraged positions may lead to forced selling, and this temporary excess supply of securities cannot absorbed by liquidity providers precisely because speculative capital has become more costly. In turn, this reduced market liquidity leads to lower prices and increased volatility, thus creating a negative feedback effect as these developments imply a further tightening of funding liquidity, culminating in further fire sales and so on. The events around the collapse of the US housing market and the 2008 Lehman bankruptcy underline the central role of this vicious circle in the propagation of shocks across markets and market participants. Uncertainty about the exposures of potential counterparties lead to a temporary breakdown of the interbank market, thereby disrupting banks’ ability to manage their liquidity and additionally distorting the transmission of monetary policy. Because many investors, including hedge funds, heavily relied on bank funding, these problems ultimately spilled over to many other asset markets as liquidity providers were forced to become liquidity consumers, which lead some markets to virtually cease to exist while others saw repeated failures of the famous law of one price, that is instruments (nearly) identical cash flows traded at different prices, creating the so-called “bases”(i.e. price gaps) as shown in the paper co-authored with Gârleanu [3]. Another important contribution of Lasse Pedersen with co-authors relates to the measurement of systemic risk with the development of indicators like the Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES) of financial institutions which jointly with Leverage is used to estimate their systemic risk contribution or the Systemic Expected Shortfall (SES) [4].  Fortunately, Lasse Pedersen’s research does only help our understanding of these phenomena but also provides exact prescriptions of what policy makers can do to improve market stability and break these vicious downward spirals. In particular, his research prescribes an intervention aimed at improving funding liquidity as a measure of breaking the mentioned downward spiral and restoring market liquidity, thereby avoiding the failure of illiquid but solvent financial institutions. Additionally, he shows that measures such as broadening the universe of acceptable collateral and adjusting margin requirements can serve as important monetary policy tools in times of protracted liquidity and are complementary to the interest rate policy [5]. In line with this, the European Central Bank has, as have many other monetary authorities around the globe, adopted several of these non-standard measures in an effort to combat a potential market breakdown and I think it is fair to say that their success in unquestionable. While considerable progress has been made with respect to our understanding of the causes, consequences and propagation of systemic financial crises, our knowledge is far from sufficient. Further advances are particularly needed in the fields of macro-prudential policy and regulation, and the Eurosystem aims to continue contributing to a filling of this knowledge gap, in particular via its Macroprudential Research Network and its involvement with the European Systemic Risk Board. I am confident that Lasse Pedersen will continue making extraordinary contributions in the coming years and hereby extend my very best congratulations to him for winning the 2011 Bernácer Prize.  I thank you for your kind attention.      [1]Viral Acharya and Lasse H. Pedersen (2005) “Asset Pricing with Liquidity Risk”, Journal of Financial Economics, 77, 375-410.
